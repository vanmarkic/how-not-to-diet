# Food Synergy System - User Guide

## Overview

This system analyzes food combinations based on Dr. Michael Greger's "The How Not to Diet Cookbook" to help you build weekly menus with maximum nutritional synergies.

## What Is Food Synergy?

Food synergy occurs when combining certain foods creates health benefits greater than eating them separately. This system identifies these combinations based on:

- **Shared beneficial categories** (anti-inflammatory, high-fiber, etc.)
- **Complementary nutrients** (greens + nuts for fat-soluble absorption)
- **Optimal timing** (greens earlier in meal, vinegar with meals)
- **Daily Dozen compliance** (Dr. Greger's recommended daily servings)
- **21 Tweaks implementation** (metabolism-boosting additions)
