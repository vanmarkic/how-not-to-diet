I didn’t stop there, though. I spent the second half of How Not to
Diet on all the tools I had unearthed in my research to drive further
weight loss for any stubborn pounds that remain.
In the first half of the book, we learned that a calorie is not
necessarily a calorie. One hundred calories of chickpeas have a
different impact than one hundred calories of chicken or chocolate,
based on their different effects on such factors as absorption, appetite
or our microbiome. In the second half, I went a step further and
explained how even the exact same foods eaten differently can have
different effects. It’s not only what we eat, but how and when .
The one piece of advice that probably best sums up my
recommended weight-loss boosters would be to wall off your calories .
Animal cells are encased only in easily digestible membranes, which
allow the enzymes in our gut to effortlessly liberate the calories within
a steak, for example. Plant cells, on the other hand, have cell walls
that are made out of fibre which acts as an indigestible physical
barrier, so many of the calories remain trapped. Processed plant
foods, however, such as fruit juice, sugar, refined grains, and even
whole grains if they’ve been powdered into flour, have had their
cellular structure destroyed and their cell walls cracked open, so their
calories are free for the taking. When you eat structurally intact plant
foods, though, you can chew all you want, but you’ll still end up with
calories completely encapsulated by fibre, which then blunts the
glycemic impact, activates what’s called the ileal brake that dials
down appetite, and delivers sustenance to your friendly flora.
So, try to make sure as many of your calories – whether from
protein, carbs or fat – are encased in cell walls. In other words, get as
many of your calories from whole, intact plant foods.
I went into this project with the goal of creating a distillation of all
the best science, but, to my delight, I discovered all sorts of exciting
new tools and tricks along the way, a treasure trove of buried data,
such as simple spices proven in randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies to accelerate weight loss for pennies a day. With so
little profit potential, it’s no wonder those studies never saw the light
of day. And I was even able to traverse beyond the existing evidence

cereals. Instead of buying boxed breakfast cereals, make oatmeal out
of whole, intact oats. They’re gr-r-oat!
With all the new data on the importance of food form, I’m starting to
sour on flour, so I advise not living by bread alone. The new structure
created by the pasta-making process can mediate these effects,
though, so you don’t have to say basta to pasta.
OPTIMIZING THE DAILY DOZEN FOR WEIGHT LOSS
A typical Green Light foods breakfast that would check off a few of
the Daily Dozen boxes would be a big bowl of oatmeal sweetened
with raisins. On the basis of what we learned in the Low in Calorie
Density, High in Water-Rich Foods, Eating Rate, and Wall Off Your
Calories sections of How Not to Diet, though, we could optimize that
meal for weight loss by making the oatmeal from steel-cut or whole
groats rather than rolled or instant, cooking it thick, and switching the
dried fruit for fresh – for example, swapping in strawberries for the
raisins. If we did want to use dried, as we learned in the Amping
AMPK and Inflammation Quenchers sections, barberries or gojis
might be a better choice.
Similarly, when choosing vegetables, we can steer toward
aboveground veggies highest on the water scale. Peppers have that
nicotine edge I described in Amping AMPK, and uncooked
vegetables in general offer more orosensory stimulation. If you want
to go underground, on the basis of what we learned about glycemic
load, sweet potatoes would be preferable to white. We certainly want
to mix it up, though, to take advantage of our built-in striving for
variety, and since vegetables represent the healthiest class of foods
with the fewest calories, we should aim to eat them earlier in the
meal.
In the Appetite Suppression section, we learned yet another reason
to include ground flaxseeds in our daily diet. Nuts are a great
complement to greens to boost the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients,
but, ideally, they should be eaten raw and whole or coarsely chopped
rather than blended into butters. This is not to say something like

where you end up or if you just want to get there quicker, are there
specific plants that have an edge? And not some tabloid-y, fat-busting
‘breakthrough’ extrapolated from test-tube data or mouse models but
from actual randomized, controlled, clinical trials showing objective
outcomes?
Yes, there are specific foods shown in interventional studies to
cause you to burn more fat, suppress your appetite, rev up your
metabolism, block the absorption of calories and effectively take
away even more calories than they provide. What’s more, the context
in which we eat matters, too. The same number of calories eaten at a
different time of the day, in a different meal distribution or after
different amounts of sleep can translate into different amounts of
body fat. Distinct forms of the exact same foods can be distinctly
fattening. Combining certain foods together can have a different effect
from eating them apart.
What we eat matters most, but how we eat and when can also
make a difference. Even the exact same foods eaten differently can
have different effects.
Importantly, these tricks and tweaks serve to supplement a healthy,
lifelong eating pattern, not replace it. Eliminating obesity requires
treating the cause, the underlying diet, but my weight-loss boosters
are for those who want all the extra help they can get.
A HEFTIER DAILY DOZEN APP
My free Dr Greger’s Daily Dozen app released soon after publication
of How Not to Die had become so popular that I decided to
completely revamp it with new features for How Not to Diet. I
incorporated all these tweaks to the Daily Dozen to optimize it for
weight control. Now, you can not only track your progress, graphing
your momentum day to day and month to month to see how well
you’re nailing each of the Daily Dozen, but since so many seemed to
really appreciate having a list of reminders to check off throughout the
day, I added an entirely new checklist to capture the weight-loss
boosters I documented in How Not to Diet. With the new, expanded
version of the app, you can track your weight and make a game out

BOXES OF TRICKS
Some of the weight-loss boosters are automatically taken care of with
the Daily Dozen. For example, fat-blocking thylakoids and calcium
are covered with my recommendation to eat lots of low-oxalate
greens. But for the others, I developed my Twenty-One Tweaks,
practical takeaways from the boosters collected into one simple list.
You may have noticed that not all the strategies I covered in part 4
of How Not to Diet are included in the list. Some only apply to certain
individuals. For example, asking people to get into the NEAT habit of
using steppers, fidget bars, or bouncing their knees during prolonged
sitting may only apply to those with desk jobs. Other accelerants may
be too risky for general consumption. For example, while the 25:5
modified fasting shows promise, you probably shouldn’t drop below
1,000 calories a day for more than twenty-four hours without medical
supervision.16 Finally, there are options that show theoretical promise
but haven’t been sufficiently vetted in clinical trials, such as pistachios
for circadian synchronization or mixing peppermint oil into hand lotion
to facilitate brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation.
So, here’s the list of strategies that made the cut – broadly
applicable, relatively safe, and evidence based. See how many of
these easily actionable tweaks you can incorporate into your daily
routine.

BREAKFAST
Is breakfast the most important meal of the day? Well, according to
chronobiology, the study of how our body’s natural cycles – mental,
physical and emotional – are affected by the rhythms of the sun,
moon and seasons, it seems that it is when it comes to losing
weight.
Calories eaten in the morning seem to be less fattening than calories
eaten in the evening. More calories are burned off in the morning
due to diet-induced thermogenesis, the amount of energy the body
takes to digest and process a meal, given off in part as waste heat.
When people consume the exact same meal in the morning,
afternoon, and at night, their body uses up about 25 per cent more
calories to process the meal in the afternoon than at night and about
