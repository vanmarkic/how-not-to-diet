Diets don’t work by definition. Going on a diet implies that, at some
point, you will go off the diet. Short-term fixes are no match for long-
term problems. Lifelong weight control requires lifelong lifestyle
changes.
First, a diet has to be sustainable. Consider water-only fasting. No
diet works better. It’s 100 per cent effective, but also 100 per cent
fatal if you manage to stick with it. This is why an optimal diet needs
additional building blocks to ensure long-term viability.
Along with being efficacious and sustainable, it needs to be safe.
Books touting liquid protein diets in the 1970s sold millions of copies,
but the diets started killing people. Safety is about losing weight
without losing your health.
Any long-term eating pattern must also be nutritionally complete,
containing all essential vitamins and minerals, and finally, our chosen
diet should be life-extending. In the very least, what we eat shouldn’t
cut our life short and ideally should be healthy enough to improve our
life spans. There’s no point in losing weight if it causes you to lose it
all.
After diving deep into the medical literature, I identified seventeen
key ingredients to the ideal weight-loss diet and dedicated a chapter
in my book How Not to Diet to each. The foods we eat and, in fact,
our meals and entire dietary patterns should be anti-inflammatory;
free from industrial pollutants; high in fibre and water; and low in high-
glycemic and addictive foods, added fat and sugar, calorie density,
meat, refined grains, and salt. They should also be low insulin index,
friendly to our friendly gut flora, particularly satiating, and rich in fruits
and vegetables as well as legumes.
We should eat real food that grows out of the ground; natural foods
that come from fields, not factories; from gardens, not garbage; a diet
centred on whole plant foods.
It turns out the healthiest diet also appears to be the most effective
diet for weight loss. Indeed, we have experimental confirmation: a
whole food, plant-based diet was found to be the single most effective
weight-loss intervention ever published in the medical literature,
proven in a randomized controlled trial with no portion control, no
calorie counting, no exercise component – the most effective ever .5

attributes that could be used to create the most effective eating plan
for losing weight.
On the next page are the seventeen ingredients for an optimum
weight-loss diet laid out in worksheet form.
In that first blank column, you can place a dietary pattern, a meal or
even an individual food. Try pencilling in some of the diets you’ve
heard about. How do they rate? How many boxes can you tick off? A
paleo diet, for example, might nail the fruit-and-vegetables box but fail
the legumes one.
The next time you sit down for supper, look at your meal and see
how many checkmarks it earns. You can imagine how a typical fast-
food meal might get a big goose egg – zero out of seventeen –
whereas a healthy Mediterranean meal might hit eleven or more due
to its vegetable-centric nature. A traditional Mediterranean bean-and-
vegetable stew would be anti-inflammatory, low on the food chain,
and high in fibre, trapped water and veggies; have a low glycemic
load and insulin index; be free of habit-forming ultraprocessed foods;
and could be low in added fat, sugar, meat, salt and refined grains.
The beans check off legumes and microbiome-building, and soups
are particularly satiating and low in calorie density. So, that one stew
could potentially check off all seventeen optimal weight-loss
ingredients. If you had it with bread dipped in oil, though, the meal as
a whole might fail to meet the glycemic and insulin response criteria
as well as the added fat, refined grains and sodium conditions, but it
would still be better than most meals people eat.

like General Tso’s chicken – deep-fried meat served in a sugary
sauce atop white rice – may not include any of the optimum weight-
loss ingredients, whereas a dish from the vegetable section, such as
broccoli with garlic sauce, might incorporate at least half of them. At a
quick-service Mexican restaurant, a bean burrito bowl salad could let
you tick off most of them, especially if you hold the white rice, but
nothing beats the control you have at home to prepare a healthy dish
without added salt, sugar, and fat.
To reverse-engineer the optimal weight-loss diet, we can figure out
what constitutes the ideal meal by ranking individual foods – and the
more boxes they check, the better. Most fruits and vegetables would
top the list at sixteen out of seventeen. By my count, legumes, whole
grains, and nuts and seeds together would hit fifteen, fourteen and
thirteen, respectively, but refined grains and animal products would
slip down into single digits. Ultraprocessed fatty and sugary snacks
might only score one or two, and a product that’s both, such as
sweet-flavoured jerky, might completely flop.
Note that some of these criteria are much more important than
others. For example, while the value of eating anti-inflammatory foods
remains theoretical, there are multiple randomized controlled trials
validating the benefits of reducing calorie density. Read through How
Not to Diet  and decide which are most convincing to you and may be
easiest to fit into your daily routine.
To varying degrees, any one of these criteria alone may facilitate
weight loss. Even just cutting out added sugars without making any
other changes at all, for example, could cause you to lose weight.
Now imagine if you tried putting them all together.
THE DAILY DOZEN DIET
In How Not to Die, I compiled the healthiest of the Green Light foods
– foods of plant origin from which nothing bad has been added and
nothing good has been taken away – into my Daily Dozen checklist of
foods I encourage people to try to fit into their daily routines. I made it
