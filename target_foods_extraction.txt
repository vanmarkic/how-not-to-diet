ARE PRE-CUT VEGETABLES JUST AS
HEALTHY?
Endotoxins come from bacteria, such as E. coli.38 Most
spoilage organisms cannot penetrate the surface barrier
of plants to spoil the inner tissues, but once you cut them
open, bacteria can gain access and vegetables can start
to spoil in a matter of days.39
What does this mean for pre-cut veggies? While it’s
better to eat pre-cut vegetables than no vegetables at all,
slicing and dicing whole veggies yourself might be
healthiest.

minutes, or until caramelized.
Remove the tray from the oven and transfer the tomato mixture to a
food processor. Process until the tomato sauce reaches the
