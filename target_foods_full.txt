ARE PRE-CUT VEGETABLES JUST AS
HEALTHY?
Endotoxins come from bacteria, such as E. coli.38 Most
spoilage organisms cannot penetrate the surface barrier
of plants to spoil the inner tissues, but once you cut them
open, bacteria can gain access and vegetables can start
to spoil in a matter of days.39
What does this mean for pre-cut veggies? While it’s
better to eat pre-cut vegetables than no vegetables at all,
slicing and dicing whole veggies yourself might be
healthiest.

Sometimes simplest is best. This easy-to-make tomato sauce
has a rich depth of flavour, owing to the slow-roasting. Try to
find large plum tomatoes for the sauce as they are less
watery than other varieties. This sauce is delicious over any
type of pasta.

2 pounds/450g ripe plum tomatoes, cored and halved
½ small red onion, chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tablespoon Italian seasoning
Ground black pepper
PASTA
8 ounces/225g whole-grain or bean-based pasta of choice
2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil finely chopped fresh parsley

sauce, leave the tomatoes in the oven for an additional 30 to 45
minutes, or until caramelized.
Remove the tray from the oven and transfer the tomato mixture to a
food processor. Process until the tomato sauce reaches the

pans from the oven and set aside.
FOR THE GARLICKY GREENS: While the vegetables are roasting, combine
the Light Vegetable Broth, garlic, oregano and red pepper flakes in a
large pot and bring to the boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat
to medium and cook for 1 minute to soften the garlic. Stir in the miso
paste, then add the greens and cook until wilted or tender. Depending
on the type of greens, this can take as few as 3 minutes (for chard or
spinach) or 25 to 45 minutes (for kale or collards). When the greens
are tender, drain off any remaining liquid.
TO SERVE:  Divide the greens among shallow bowls or serving plates.
Top with the roasted root vegetables, sprinkle with black pepper to

Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 5
minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer; then stir in the
kale, mushrooms, beans, tomatoes, nutritional yeast, miso paste,
parsley, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes and black pepper. Simmer
over a medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is
absorbed. Stir in the Mushroom–Walnut Crumbles and mix well to
combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed. If the stuffing is
too wet, add a little nutritional yeast or ground flaxseeds and combine
well.
Fill the peppers with the stuffing, then place them upright in the
prepared baking dish. Cover and bake until the peppers are tender ,
25 to 30 minutes.
Serve hot, topped with the tomato sauce (if using) and sprinkled with
Brazil Nut Parm.

SAGE-KISSED SWEET POTATO WEDGES WITH
SHALLOTS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
These roasted sweet potatoes are made even more
flavoursome with the addition of malt vinegar, cornmeal and
spices. If you prefer them unadorned, simply omit all the other
ingredients and just roast the sweet potato wedges. They will
still be delicious.
3 sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds/900g)
⅓ cup/50ml malt vinegar or apple cider vinegar, plus more to serve
⅓ cup/40g coarse cornmeal/polenta, blue if available
1 tablespoon smoked paprika

3 shallots, quartered lengthways (optional)
Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line a large baking
tray with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Cut each sweet potato lengthways, into ½-inch/1cm wedges and
place them in a bowl. Pour the vinegar onto the sweet potatoes and
toss to coat.
In a small bowl, combine the cornmeal/polenta, paprika and sage.
Mix well, and then sprinkle the seasoning mixture onto the sweet
potatoes. Toss gently until evenly coated.
Arrange the sweet potato wedges in a single layer on the prepared
tray, then distribute the shallots (if using) among them. Roast in the

VEGETABLE PAELLA WITH GOLDEN BARLEY
MAKES: 4 to 6 servings  DIFFICULTY: Easy
Paella is traditionally made with Spanish Valencia rice, but
this version uses pot barley, which adds a chewy, nutty
component to this flavoursome dish. Instead of the customary
saffron, I use turmeric to achieve the same golden colour at a
fraction of the cost.
3¼ cups/810ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
1 onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 red pepper, de-seeded and diced
1 yellow or green pepper, de-seeded and diced
2 (400g) BPA-free tins or Tetra Paks salt-free chopped tomatoes, undrained
1 cup/200g uncooked pot barley, soaked overnight in water and then drained
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground fennel
1 (½-inch/1cm) piece fresh turmeric, grated, or ½ teaspoon ground
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
1½ cups/260g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free cannellini
beans, drained and rinsed
1 (400g) BPA-free tin artichoke hearts, drained and quartered
1 cup/150g peas
3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
1 lemon, cut into wedges

Heat ¼ cup/60ml of the Light Vegetable Broth in a large saucepan or
paella pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until
just softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in the red and yellow or green
peppers, tomatoes with their juices, barley, paprika, fennel, turmeric,
oregano and red pepper flakes. Stir in the remaining broth and bring
to the boil. Lower the heat to a low simmer, cover, and cook until the
barley is tender, 45 to 50 minutes.
Once the barley is tender, uncover, stir in the cannellini beans,
artichoke hearts and peas, and then cover and set aside for 10
minutes before serving. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.
Sprinkle with the parsley, garnish with lemon wedges, and serve hot.

PAGE 251 - Found: chard
================================================================================
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons ground walnuts
1 lemon, cut into wedges (optional)
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, pepper and garlic and
cook until softened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
chard, Umami Sauce Redux, paprika, thyme and black pepper to
taste and cook for 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl and set aside;
then return the skillet to the heat.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml water in the same skillet and add the onion and
celery. Cook over a medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Stir in the nutritional yeast, flaxseeds, miso paste
and marjoram. Add the white beans and a little more water if needed,
so the ingredients don’t stick to the pan. Lower the heat to low and
cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and
set aside to cool. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.
Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor and blend until
smooth.
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.
In a medium bowl, combine the cooked oat groats, quinoa and millet
along with the onion powder, garlic powder, spring onions and
parsley. Add about ¾ cup/175ml of the pureed white bean mixture
and mix well. Evenly press the mixture into the bottom and up the
sides of a deep-dish 9-inch/23cm pie plate to form the crust. Bake the
crust for 10 minutes; then remove from the oven and set aside.
Add the remaining bean mixture to the chard mixture and mix well.
Evenly spread the chard mixture over the crust. Sprinkle the top with
ground walnuts and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until nicely
browned.
Remove from the oven and let sit for at least 15 minutes before
slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature with lemon wedges (if

FOR THE LOAF:  Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Line an
8-x 4-inch/10 × 20cm loaf tin with a piece of baking parchment the
same length of the tin and long enough to come over the sides by a
few inches/5cm.
Combine the onion, garlic and walnuts in a food processor and pulse
until finely chopped. Add all the remaining loaf ingredients and
process until well combined. If the mixture is too wet to hold together ,
add more nutritional yeast or ground walnuts and combine well.
Transfer the loaf mixture into the prepared tin. Press the mixture
firmly into the tin and smooth out the top. Bake until firm and golden
brown, 50 to 60 minutes. Check its progress at around 40 minutes
and if the top is getting too brown, cover with foil for the remaining
baking time.

MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
These overnight oat groats, also known as groatmeal, are a
quick and easy way to have a hearty, flavoursome breakfast.
1 cup/180g oat groats
2 ripe bananas
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 tablespoons chopped pecans
Date Syrup (here) (optional)
The night before, bring 2 cups/500ml of water to the boil in a medium
saucepan. Add the oat groats, cover, and return to the boil for 2
minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Set aside, covered, until
morning.
The next morning, return the covered saucepan to the stovetop.
Remove the lid and cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally ,
for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the oats are tender and heated through. If
all the water is absorbed before the oats become tender, add up to ½
cup/120ml of additional water and continue to cook while stirring
occasionally for a few more minutes until tender.
Peel and chop the bananas and add to the oats along with the
nutmeg. Cook, stirring, over a low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to combine
and blend the flavours. To serve, spoon into serving bowls and
sprinkle with chopped pecans and a swirl of Date Syrup (if using).

FRESH BERRIES WITH CHOCOLATE BALSAMIC
SYRUP
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Make this quick and easy treat at the peak of berry season. I
like to combine several different berries, but it’s also delicious
with just one or two types, if you prefer. This recipe serves
four, but if you’re making it for just one or two people, cut
back on the amount of berries and/or only add the mint leaves
and balsamic when ready to serve.
⅓ cup/75ml chocolate balsamic vinegar or Balsamic Syrup (here)
1½ cups/225g strawberries, hulled and halved
¾ cup/95g raspberries
1 cup/100g blueberries
½ cup/75g blackberries
2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves
1 tablespoon cacao nibs
¼ cup/30g coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)
If not using Balsamic Syrup, pour the chocolate balsamic vinegar into
a small saucepan and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, or
until reduced by about one-third. Remove from the heat and set the
vinegar aside to cool to room temperature before using.
In a large serving bowl, combine all the berries with the mint leaves.
Spoon into individual glass serving bowls and drizzle on the
chocolate balsamic reduction or Balsamic Syrup. Top with the cacao
nibs and nuts (if using).

1 cup/175g fresh or thawed frozen diced mango
4 tablespoons ground chia seeds
Optional garnishes: diced mango, fresh raspberries, sunflower seeds or

In a high-powered blender, combine the raspberries, mango, and ½
cup/120ml of water and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into two
dessert bowls or glass jars. Add 2 tablespoons of the ground chia
seeds to each bowl and stir until evenly distributed. Cover and
refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Serve as is or topped with garnish
of choice.
IS MELAMINE SAFE?
Melamine, used to make inexpensive, hard plastic
kitchenware, isn’t suitable for microwaves and cooking,98
but what about for just eating or drinking? Exposure to
the
chemical compound is significantly associated with
kidney function deterioration in patients with early-stage
chronic kidney disease,99 so I’d skip melamine
altogether.

Satisfying, delicious and versatile, smoothie bowls are thick
smoothies you can eat with a spoon. This is the ultimate
customizable dish: change up the fruits to suit your own taste
and use whichever toppings you prefer. Smoothie bowls are
especially good for breakfast or dessert. I like to keep banana
chunks in my freezer so I always have them on hand. Frozen
mango and pineapple, readily available in supermarkets, are
convenient and often less expensive than fresh.
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
2 ripe bananas, peeled, cut into chunks and frozen
1 cup/175g diced fresh or frozen mango
1 cup/200g diced fresh or frozen pineapple
Optional toppings: goji berries, sliced banana, berries, cacao nibs, ground

These crumbles add tremendous texture and flavour.
Sprinkle them on top of cooked whole grains and vegetables,

In the same food processor (no need to wipe it out), combine the
walnuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds and pulse to coarsely
grind. Add the ground nuts and seeds to the bowl of finely chopped
mushrooms. Add all the remaining ingredients. Mix well.
Heat a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat.
Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, or until the
mushroom liquid has been released and evaporated, and crumbles
begin to form. Cook a few minutes longer, until the crumbles begin to
crisp. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Use the crumbles
immediately in recipes, or store them in an airtight container in the
refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
For Variation:  Substitute cold cooked whole grains (barley is a good
choice) or grated cauliflower for the mushrooms.
BASIC BROL (BARLEY, RYE, OATS AND LENTILS)
MAKES: 5 cups/900g  DIFFICULTY: Easy
BROL stands for barley, rye, oats and lentils. Barley groats,
sold as pot or hull-less barley, rye grains, and oat groats are
available in well-stocked supermarkets or online. Use purple
barley, if you can find it, for the extra antioxidant boost. For
the same reason, I use black lentils because they are the
most antioxidant-packed lentils. Sometimes sold as beluga
lentils due to their resemblance to caviar, you can also find
black lentils in well-stocked supermarkets or online. For a
gluten-free version of my Basic BROL, use gluten-free oats
and substitute sorghum and millet for the rye and barley
(SMOL!). Finger millet is one of the healthiest types. For
convenience, you may want to cook your whole grains and

½ pepper of any colour, de-seeded and finely chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
1 jalapeño pepper or other small hot chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander or parsley
Super-Charged Spice Blend (here)
Combine all the ingredients, including the Super-Charged Spice
Blend to taste, in a bowl and stir to combine. Cover and let stand at
room temperature for 1 hour before serving. If not using right away ,
store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The salsa will keep
refrigerated for 3 to 4 days.
BRAZIL NUT PARM
MAKES: 1½ cups/200g DIFFICULTY: Easy
I store this topping in a glass shaker with large holes and a
tight-fitting lid so I can easily sprinkle it onto pasta and whole-
grain dishes or salads for a cheesy flavour. Although the
recipe calls for Brazil nuts and cashews, I sometimes mix it
up and substitute other varieties of nuts. Experiment
creatively and enjoy!
¾ cup/100g raw Brazil nuts
¼ cup/40g raw cashews
