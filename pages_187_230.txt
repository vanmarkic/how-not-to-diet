Arrange the cauliflower slices and potatoes in the prepared roasting
tin. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, then remove the pan from the
oven and turn over the vegetables with a metal spatula. Add the
mushrooms and tomatoes, and return the tin to the oven. Roast until
the vegetables are fork-tender and nicely browned, about 15 minutes
longer.
Meanwhile, make the sauce. In a high-powered blender or food
processor, combine the garlic, miso paste and turmeric and blend
until the garlic is finely chopped. Add the Light Vegetable Broth,
lemon juice, nutritional yeast, onion powder, mustard, black pepper to
taste and white beans. Blend until very smooth.
Transfer the sauce to a small saucepan and heat over a low heat. Stir
in the spring onion and parsley and taste to adjust the seasonings, if
needed. Keep warm.
When the vegetables are done roasting, transfer them to a serving
platter and spoon the sauce over the top. Serve hot.

BALSAMIC BUTTERNUT, BRUSSELS AND
BEETROOT
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
If your beetroot comes with nice greens attached, consider
cooking them up to serve as a bed for these beautiful
alliterative veggies.
1 butternut squash, halved, de-seeded and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm dice (about
3½ cups)
1 pound/450g Brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved lengthways
1 bunch beetroot (3 to 4 medium beetroot, or about 1 pound/450g), trimmed
and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm dice
1 red onion, cut into ½-inch/1cm dice
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon ground coriander
2 teaspoons Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend (here)
¼ cup/60ml Balsamic Syrup ( here)
Ground black pepper
Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line one or two large,
rimmed baking trays with silicone mats or baking parchment.
Spread the squash, Brussels sprouts, beetroot and onion in a single
layer on the prepared tray(s). Season with the oregano, coriander
and 1 teaspoon of the Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend. Roast in the
oven for 30 to 45 minutes, or until tender, turning the vegetables
once, about halfway through.
Remove the tray(s) from the oven and transfer the vegetables to a
serving dish. Drizzle with the Balsamic Syrup, season with the

=== PAGE 190 ===
remaining 1 teaspoon of Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend and black
pepper to taste and serve hot.
ARE GREENS AND BEETS BRAIN FOOD?
Our brain produces the artery-dilating compound nitric
oxide, which is boosted by nitrate-rich vegetable
consumption. After drinking 2 cups/500ml of beetroot
juice, which has about as much nitrate as 2 cups/450g of
cooked rocket, performance in a subtraction task was
significantly improved, suggesting one dose of nitrate-
rich vegetables can modify brain function. And our brain
structure? Exercise alone may not result in any significant
change, but, after the same amount of exercise and
drinking some beetroot juice, there was a noticeable
improvement.56
Can’t beet that!

VEGETABLE TART

=== PAGE 192 ===
MAKES: 4 to 6 servings  DIFFICULTY: Moderate
With two kinds of beans and loads of veggies, this beautiful
tart with its chickpea crust has a lot going for it. Drizzle each
serving with a little Balsamic Syrup to brighten the flavour
even more. This will serve four as a main dish or six as a side
dish.
CRUST
1½/250g cups cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free
chickpeas, drained and rinsed, then blotted dry
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
1 tablespoon white miso paste
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon dried basil
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
FILLING
1 small red onion, finely chopped
1 small red pepper, de-seeded and chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 courgette, cut into thin rounds
6 ounces/150g white or baby portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced
4 spring onions, finely chopped
2 teaspoons white miso paste
1 teaspoon dried basil

=== PAGE 193 ===
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1½ cups/260g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free white
beans, drained and rinsed
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
½ teaspoon paprika
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 (½-inch/1cm) piece fresh turmeric, grated, or ½ teaspoon ground
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 cup/150g cherry tomatoes, halved lengthways
¼ cup/25g ground walnuts (optional)
Balsamic Syrup (here)
FOR THE CRUST: Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Cut a
sheet of baking parchment to fit inside the bottom of a 9-inch/23cm
springform tin. Line the tin and set aside.
In a food processor, combine all the crust ingredients and process
until smooth. The mixture should hold together when pinched
between two fingers. If it is too dry, blend in a little water, 1
tablespoon at a time. Transfer the chickpea mixture to the prepared
tin. With damp fingers, press it down into the bottom of the prepared
tin to spread it evenly. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven
and set aside.
FOR THE FILLING:  Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-
based frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the onion, pepper
and garlic and cook for 5 minutes to soften, adding a little more water
if needed so the vegetables do not scorch. Stir in the courgette,
mushrooms, spring onions, miso paste, basil, marjoram and black
pepper. Cook, stirring, until all the vegetables are tender and the

=== PAGE 194 ===
liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir to mix well; then remove
from the heat and set aside.
In a blender or food processor, combine the white beans, nutritional
yeast, apple cider vinegar, ground chia seeds, paprika, onion powder
and turmeric. Process until smooth. Stir in the parsley.
Spread the white bean mixture evenly over the chickpea crust, and
then spread the vegetables evenly over the top. Arrange the tomato
halves, cut side down, on top of the vegetables in a concentric
pattern around the edge, pressing the tomatoes into the vegetables.
Sprinkle the top with walnuts (if using). Bake until hot and set, 18 to
20 minutes.
Remove from the oven and let the tart cool for about 10 minutes, then
cut into wedges and serve hot, drizzled with Balsamic Syrup.

ARTICHOKE AND SPINACH STUFFED
PORTOBELLOS
MAKES: 2 to 4 servings  DIFFICULTY: Easy

=== PAGE 196 ===
If you like artichoke dip, a perennial favourite, you’ll love this
healthier and more flavour-packed version that we stuff into
meaty portobellos. I like to serve two mushrooms per person
as a main dish or one each as a side.
9–10 ounces/250–300g fresh or thawed frozen spinach, lightly steamed and
cooled
1 cup/175g cooked* or BPA-free tinned or Tetra Pak salt-free white beans,
drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons finely chopped spring onion
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon white miso paste
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free artichoke hearts, drained, or 1 (10-
ounce/300g) package frozen artichokes, cooked and cooled
4 large portobello mushrooms, stems removed
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
½ teaspoon onion powder
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
Squeeze the excess moisture from the cooled spinach and set the
greens aside.
In a food processor, combine the white beans, spring onion and garlic
and pulse until finely chopped. Add the nutritional yeast, lemon juice,
miso paste and black pepper and process until smooth and well
blended. Add the artichokes and pulse until they are chopped. Add
the spinach and pulse to combine. Set aside.

=== PAGE 197 ===
Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5. Line a baking tray with
a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Arrange the mushroom caps, stem side down, in the prepared tray.
Whisk together the apple cider vinegar, onion powder and black
pepper in a small bowl and brush it on the mushrooms. Bake for 10
minutes to slightly soften the portobellos. Remove the tray from the
oven and set aside until the mushrooms are cool enough to handle.
Gently flip the mushrooms and stuff them with the filling. Return the
tray to the oven and bake the stuffed mushrooms for 15 minutes, or
until hot throughout.
Remove the tray from the oven and serve the stuffed mushrooms
immediately.

PEPPERS STUFFED WITH BLACK BEANS AND
MUSHROOM–WALNUT CRUMBLES
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
The seasonings in this recipe give this stuffing a flavour
similar to Italian sausage. Serve these stuffed peppers as is
or top them with some warmed tomato sauce. (The Roasted
Tomato Sauce on here is my first choice, but your favourite
salt-free marinara is fine.)
4 large peppers (any colour), tops cut off and seeds removed
1 small red onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
4 cups/260g finely chopped kale
4 ounces/115g white mushrooms, chopped
1½ cups/250g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free black
beans, drained and rinsed
3 plum tomatoes, cored and finely chopped, or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra
Pak salt-free chopped tomatoes, drained and finely chopped
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
½ teaspoon ground fennel seeds
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 cup/120g Mushroom–Walnut Crumbles (here)
Warm tomato sauce (optional)
2 tablespoons Brazil Nut Parm ( here)

=== PAGE 200 ===
Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5. Pour about 1
inch/2.5cm of water into a shallow baking dish and set aside.
Lightly steam the peppers on a rack set over boiling water in a large
pot for 3 to 4 minutes, to soften them slightly. Remove the peppers
from the steamer and set aside, cut side down, to drain.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft, about 5
minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute longer; then stir in the
kale, mushrooms, beans, tomatoes, nutritional yeast, miso paste,
parsley, fennel seeds, red pepper flakes and black pepper. Simmer
over a medium heat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the liquid is
absorbed. Stir in the Mushroom–Walnut Crumbles and mix well to
combine. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed. If the stuffing is
too wet, add a little nutritional yeast or ground flaxseeds and combine
well.
Fill the peppers with the stuffing, then place them upright in the
prepared baking dish. Cover and bake until the peppers are tender ,
25 to 30 minutes.
Serve hot, topped with the tomato sauce (if using) and sprinkled with
Brazil Nut Parm.

ROASTED KABOCHA WITH KALE–CRANBERRY
STUFFING
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
Rather than starchy, boring bread cubes, the stuffing for this
dish is made with my Basic BROL (Barley, Rye, Oats and
Lentils), combined with onion, celery, kale and cranberries. I
like to serve it as is or topped with the Miso–Mushroom
Sauce featured on here. To mix it up, try swapping in any
combination of cooked whole grains with beans in place of
the Basic BROL.
1 large kabocha squash, halved crossways (see Hint*)
½ cup/75g chopped red onion
½ cup/50g finely chopped celery
½ cup/50g cranberries
1 cup/30g finely shredded kale or other dark leafy greens of choice
1 tablespoon Umami Sauce Redux (here)
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme leaves, or ½ teaspoon dried
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh rosemary leaves, or ½ teaspoon dried
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh sage leaves, or ½ teaspoon dried
Ground black pepper
2 cups/360g Basic BROL (here)
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4. Line a roasting tin with
a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Using a strong knife, cut the cap off of the squash. With a spoon,
scrape out and discard its seeds and fibres. Set aside.

=== PAGE 203 ===
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium heat. Add the onion and celery and cook for 5
minutes. Stir in the cranberries, kale, Umami Sauce Redux, thyme,
rosemary, sage and black pepper to taste. Remove from the heat and
stir in the Basic BROL until well combined.
Spoon the stuffing into the centre of each half of the squash. Transfer
the squash to the prepared roasting tin and bake for 1 hour 20
minutes. If the stuffing is getting too browned, cover it loosely with
foil. Check the squash for tenderness after the baking time. If it
cannot be pierced with the tip of a knife, return the the squash to the
oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes longer, or until the squash is soft
and easily pierced with a knife. Serve hot.
* Hint:  To make a hard winter squash easier to cut, pierce the skin of
the squash in a few places (to let the steam escape), then microwave
it on High for 3 to 4 minutes. The squash will soften enough to cut
easily.
BERRIES FOR INFLAMMATION AND
OSTEOARTHRITIS
Higher intake of anthocyanins, berries’ brightly coloured
pigments, has been associated with anti-inflammatory
effects, which may be a key component in reduced
chronic disease risk.57
Can strawberries improve pain and inflammation in knee
osteoarthritis? Yes! Simply adding berries to one’s diet
may have a significant impact on pain, inflammation, and
overall quality of life.58

CUMIN-ROASTED CARROTS WITH CHICKPEAS
AND TOMATOES
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Enjoy these savoury veggies as is, or serve over your
favourite cooked whole grains or leafy greens. Roasting time
depends on the size of your carrots – thinner carrots may be
done in 20 to 25 minutes, while larger ones may take up to 45
minutes – so adjust accordingly.
1 pound/450g carrots, multicolour if available, cut diagonally into 1½-inch/4cm
pieces
1½ cups/250g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free
chickpeas, drained and rinsed
Spritz of apple cider vinegar (see Hint**)
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground coriander
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
3 cups/450g cherry tomatoes, halved lengthways
Cooked whole grains* or greens (optional)
¼ cup/4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or coriander
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Line a large, rimmed
baking tray with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Spread the carrots and chickpeas in a single layer on the prepared
tray. Spritz with apple cider vinegar and then sprinkle evenly with the
cumin, coriander and black pepper. Roast in the oven for about 15
minutes, more or less, depending on the size of the carrots. Then,
remove the tray from the oven and scatter the tomatoes over and
around the carrots and chickpeas. Return the tray to the oven and

=== PAGE 206 ===
continue to roast until the chickpeas are nearly crunchy and the
carrots are tender and lightly charred, about 15 minutes more.
Serve in shallow bowls or plates over cooked whole grains or greens
(if using), and sprinkle with the parsley. Serve hot.
* Turn to the Legumes and Grains Cooking Charts here for
instruction, if needed.
** Hint: Keep a spray bottle handy with your favourite vinegar. Spritz
vegetables before roasting to help spices adhere and to add a last-
minute burst of flavour to salads and other dishes. I also give my air -
popped popcorn a spritz or two so that nutritional yeast sticks on
even better.

SAGE-KISSED SWEET POTATO WEDGES WITH
SHALLOTS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
These roasted sweet potatoes are made even more
flavoursome with the addition of malt vinegar, cornmeal and
spices. If you prefer them unadorned, simply omit all the other
ingredients and just roast the sweet potato wedges. They will
still be delicious.
3 sweet potatoes (about 2 pounds/900g)
⅓ cup/50ml malt vinegar or apple cider vinegar, plus more to serve
⅓ cup/40g coarse cornmeal/polenta, blue if available
1 tablespoon smoked paprika
2 teaspoons ground sage
3 shallots, quartered lengthways (optional)
Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line a large baking
tray with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Cut each sweet potato lengthways, into ½-inch/1cm wedges and
place them in a bowl. Pour the vinegar onto the sweet potatoes and
toss to coat.
In a small bowl, combine the cornmeal/polenta, paprika and sage.
Mix well, and then sprinkle the seasoning mixture onto the sweet
potatoes. Toss gently until evenly coated.
Arrange the sweet potato wedges in a single layer on the prepared
tray, then distribute the shallots (if using) among them. Roast in the
oven for 30 minutes, or until soft and lightly browned, turning over the

=== PAGE 209 ===
sweet potatoes after 15 minutes. Serve immediately, with a little more
vinegar if desired.

BEANS
Dietary fibre is found in all whole plant foods, but it is most
concentrated in legumes, such as split peas, chickpeas, lentils, and
beans,59 the stars of the recipes in this section. Did you know the
amount of fibre in a single ½-cup/80g daily serving of beans over
about a two-year period was associated with a ‘profound’ 25 per cent
difference in abdominal obesity in overweight youth,60 and, in about
the same time frame, each 2-gram increase in daily fibre was
associated with a weight decrease of about a pound/0.5kg in middle-
aged women?61
Beans can also keep us feeling fuller for much longer.62 By eating
fibre-rich foods on a daily basis, we can set ourselves up for

=== PAGE 211 ===
success, and the recipes in this section are sure to be a success at
the dinner table.

COTTAGE PIE WITH SWEET POTATO MASH
MAKES: 4 to 6 servings  DIFFICULTY: Moderate
One of my favourite comfort foods. This warm, savoury dish is
just as flavoursome with mashed cauliflower instead of the
sweet potato topping, so mix it up if the mood strikes.
2 pounds/900g sweet potato, cut into 2-inch/5cm chunks
½ teaspoon onion powder
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1 small red onion, chopped
1 carrot, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1½ cups/260g fresh or thawed frozen sweetcorn
1 cup/150g fresh or thawed frozen peas
1 cup/170g cooked* fresh or frozen broad beans
2 cups/400g cooked* or BPA-free tinned or Tetra Pak salt-free brown lentils
1 cup/250ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
8 ounces/225g mushrooms of choice, chopped
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons salt-free tomato puree
1 tablespoon white miso paste
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh thyme, or ½ teaspoon dried
Place the sweet potatoes into a large pot with enough cold water to
cover and bring to the boil. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until fork-
tender, then drain and return to the pot. Stir in the onion powder and
black pepper and mash until smooth. Set aside.

=== PAGE 214 ===
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium heat. Add the onion and carrot and cook until
softened, about 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and lower the heat to low .
Stir in the sweetcorn, peas and cooked broad beans. Cook until the
vegetables are tender and any liquid is absorbed, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir
in three quarters of the lentils, then transfer the vegetable mixture to a
shallow baking dish and set aside.
Heat the Light Vegetable Broth in the same large skillet over a
medium heat. Add the mushrooms, nutritional yeast, tomato puree,
miso paste and thyme and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes, or until the
mushrooms are soft. Transfer the mushroom mixture to a blender or
food processor, add the remaining lentils and blend until smooth. If
the gravy is too thick, blend in up to ½ cup/120ml of additional broth.
Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.
Pour the gravy over the vegetable mixture, stirring to combine.
Spread the mashed sweet potatoes on top, smoothing to cover the
surface. Bake for about 30 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling.
Serve hot.

CORNMEAL-CRUSTED BUFFALO TEMPEH WITH
WHITE BEAN RANCH
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
The White Bean Ranch isn’t only the perfect dipping sauce for
this tempeh dish – it also makes a great salad dressing.
WHITE BEAN RANCH
½ cup/90g cooked* or BPA-free tinned or Tetra Pak salt-free white beans,
drained and rinsed
¼ cup/40g raw cashews, soaked for 30 minutes in hot water and then drained
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon white miso paste
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh dill, or ¼ teaspoon dried
1 teaspoon finely chopped fresh chives, or ½ teaspoon dried
TEMPEH
¾ cup/90g coarse-ground cornmeal/polenta, blue if available
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend (here)
1 pound/450g tempeh, cut into 1-x 3-inch (2.5 × 7.5cm) bars
⅔ cup/150ml Salt-Free Hot Sauce ( here), or more

=== PAGE 217 ===
FOR THE WHITE BEAN RANCH: In a high-powered blender, combine ⅓
cup/75ml of water with all the ingredients, except the parsley, dill and
chives, and blend until smooth. Transfer the dressing to a bowl and
stir in the parsley, dill and chives. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if
needed, noting that the flavour will get stronger as the dressing sits. If
the dressing is too thick, add a little more water and mix well. Cover
and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to allow the flavours to develop. Stir
or shake before serving.
FOR THE TEMPEH: Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line a
large, rimmed roasting tin with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal/polenta, nutritional yeast,
garlic powder and Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend. Stream in ¾
cup/175ml of water and whisk until smooth. Add the tempeh to the
batter, turning to coat each piece. Arrange the battered tempeh
pieces on the prepared tin but do not let them touch. Bake for 15
minutes, turning halfway through.
Pour the Salt-Free Hot Sauce into a large bowl. When the tempeh is
done baking, remove it from the oven and gently toss it in the hot
sauce to coat well. Return the tempeh pieces to the roasting tin and
bake for 10 minutes longer, or until they become nicely browned.
Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving. If
you like extra heat, toss the tempeh in additional hot sauce before
serving.
TO SERVE:  Place a small bowl containing the White Bean Ranch in the
centre of a platter, surround with the tempeh, and serve.

RED BEAN AND BEETROOT CUTLETS

=== PAGE 219 ===
MAKES: 6 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
Serve these cutlets on a bed of cooked greens. Enjoy as is,
or top with your favourite sauce or a drizzle of Balsamic Syrup
(here) or Umami Sauce Redux ( here). These cutlets are also
delicious served cold. Try slicing them and wrapping in lettuce
leaves. This recipe is a great way to use up leftover cooked
whole grains. If you don’t want to roast or steam your own
beetroot, look for precooked ones in the produce section of
your supermarket.
1½ cups/260g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free red kidney
beans, drained and rinsed, then blotted dry
½ cup/60g chopped walnuts
¾ cup/140g cooked* quinoa, millet or other whole grain, blotted dry
½ cup/100g chopped roasted or steamed beetroot, blotted dry
¼ cup/40g finely chopped red onion
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
2 teaspoons salt-free tomato puree
¾ teaspoon Super-Charged Spice Blend (here), or to taste
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon white miso paste
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
In a food processor, combine the beans, walnuts, cooked quinoa,
beetroot and onion and process until well combined. Add all the

=== PAGE 220 ===
remaining ingredients and process to mix well.
Transfer the mixture to a work surface and divide into six balls (or
more or less, depending on how large you want your cutlets). The
mixture will be soft. If it is too soft to handle, add a bit more ground
walnuts or nutritional yeast and combine well. Use your hands to
firmly shape each ball into a thin cutlet, pressing the mixture so the
cutlets hold together. Set the cutlets aside on a plate and refrigerate
for 1 hour or longer. (You may also wrap the cutlets tightly and freeze
them for later use.)
Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5. Line a large baking
tray with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Arrange the cutlets on the prepared baking tray. Bake for 15 minutes,
use a metal spatula to flip each cutlet; then bake for about 15 minutes
longer, or until firm. Serve hot.

PERSIAN BLACK-EYED BEANS AND GREENS

=== PAGE 222 ===
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
A variety of fragrant spices turns a simple meal of beans and
greens into something truly special. Black-eyed beans are
available dried, frozen and tinned. If using dried or frozen, be
sure to plan ahead to allow for enough time to cook them
before you prepare the recipe.
1 large red onion, chopped
2 carrots, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons salt-free tomato puree
2 teaspoons white miso paste
1½ pounds/675g kale or collard greens, tough stems removed, coarsely
chopped
2 cups/340g cooked* black-eyed beans
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon dried fenugreek
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon ground cardamom
¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon
⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg or cloves
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
Hot cooked* whole grains (optional)
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large pot or deep skillet over a
medium-high heat. Add the onion and carrots and cook until softened,
about 5 minutes. Stir in the tomato puree and miso paste; then add

=== PAGE 223 ===
the kale and 1 cup/250ml of water. Cover and simmer until the greens
are tender, stirring occasionally.
Add the cooked black-eyed beans, coriander, cumin, fenugreek,
turmeric, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon and nutmeg. If the
mixture is too thick, add a little more water to make it a bit saucy .
Simmer for about 10 minutes to heat through and combine the
flavours. Just before serving, stir in the lemon juice. Serve hot as is or
over your favourite cooked whole grains.
* Turn to the Legumes and Grains Cooking Charts here for
instruction, if needed.
HOW TO COOK GREENS
Although eating greens fresh is best, steaming’s not bad,
microwaving comes in second, and stir-frying and boiling
fall to the bottom of the barrel.63
What about kale specifically? Blanching and steaming
kale actually boost antioxidant content, whereas
microwaving or even boiling doesn’t seem to do much.
So, you can boil kale without losing out on its antioxidant
punch.64

BUTTERNUT–BLACK BEAN CHILLI

=== PAGE 225 ===
MAKES: 4 to 6 servings  DIFFICULTY: Easy
Black beans marry chunks of butternut squash in this
delicious chilli. If you won’t have time to cut up a squash, look
for diced squash in the produce section of your supermarket.
2 cups/500ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
1 red onion, chopped
3 cups/420g peeled, de-seeded and diced butternut squash
1 pepper (any colour), de-seeded and chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 small hot chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped
¼ cup/4 tablespoons salt-free tomato puree
2 tablespoons chilli powder, or to taste

BBQ TEMPEH WITH SWEET POTATOES AND
COLLARDS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
This medley of collard greens, sweet potatoes and barbecued
tempeh is a taste of the South served in one bowl. The dish is
as delicious with kale in place of collards, so feel free to mix
up your greens.
COLLARDS
1 small red onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon cayenne, or more to taste
Ground black pepper
2 cups/500ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
1 bunch collard greens (about 12 ounces/350g), thick stems removed, coarsely
chopped
Apple cider vinegar
SWEET POTATOES
2 large sweet potatoes, cut into 1-inch/2.5cm dice
Spritz of apple cider vinegar (see Hint*)
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
Ground black pepper
TEMPEH
8 ounces/225g tempeh, cut into ½-inch/1cm strips

=== PAGE 229 ===
1 cup/250ml Umami Sauce Redux ( here)
2 tablespoons salt-free tomato puree
2 teaspoons salt-free mustard
TO SERVE
1 teaspoon coarsely ground nigella seeds
FOR THE COLLARDS: Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large pot over a
medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5 minutes to soften. Add
the garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Stir in the cumin, smoked
paprika, cayenne and black pepper to taste. Add the Light Vegetable
Broth and bring to the boil; then lower the heat to a simmer and add
the collard greens, stirring to wilt. Cover and cook for 30 minutes.
Uncover and continue to cook until the collards are tender and the
liquid has mostly evaporated. When ready to serve, stir in a little
apple cider vinegar. Keep warm.
FOR THE SWEET POTATOES:  While the collards are cooking, preheat the
oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line a large, rimmed baking tray
with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Arrange the diced sweet potato in a single layer on the prepared
baking tray. Spritz the sweet potatoes with apple cider vinegar and
season with onion powder, smoked paprika and black pepper to
taste. Bake for 20 to 30 minutes, or until tender, turning once about
halfway through. Keep warm.
FOR THE TEMPEH: Heat ⅓ cup/75ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-
based frying pan over a medium heat. Add the tempeh and cook for 5
minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in the Umami Sauce Redux, tomato
puree, mustard and 3 more tablespoons of water. Lower the heat to
low, cover, and cook for 15 minutes, periodically spooning the sauce
over the tempeh to coat.
TO SERVE:  Divide the collards among shallow bowls. Spoon the
tempeh in the centre, and then arrange the sweet potatoes on either
side. Sprinkle with nigella seeds and serve hot.

*Hint:  Keep a spray bottle handy with your favourite vinegar. Spritz
vegetables before roasting to help spices adhere and to add a last-
minute burst of flavour to salads and other dishes. I also give air -
popped popcorn a spritz or two so that nutritional yeast sticks on
even better.
