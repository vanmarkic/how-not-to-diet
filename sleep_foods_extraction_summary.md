# Sleep-Supporting Foods Extraction Summary

## Important Finding

**The specific sleep foods requested (tart cherries, kiwi, chamomile, passionflower, valerian, bananas, lavender) are NOT mentioned in "The How Not to Diet Cookbook".**

This cookbook focuses on **timing strategies and circadian rhythm optimization** rather than specific sleep-inducing foods with melatonin, tryptophan, or serotonin content.

## Comprehensive Search Performed

- Tart cherry/cherries, cherry juice
- Kiwi/kiwifruit
- Chamomile
- Passionflower/passion flower
- Valerian
- Banana/bananas
- Lavender
- Tryptophan
- Serotonin
- Melatonin

**Result:** NONE of these foods are mentioned in the available text.

## Already Extracted Sleep-Related Items

**Pistachios** (food-76) - Mentioned for circadian synchronization with melatonin content (theoretical, not clinically proven yet)

## Sleep Support Mechanisms in This Book

Rather than specific sleep foods, the book emphasizes:

1. **Behavioral Sleep Hygiene**
   - Get 7+ hours at regular bedtime
   - Maintain consistent sleep schedule

2. **Circadian-Aligned Eating**
   - Fast after 7 PM (12+ hours)
   - Front-load calories to breakfast
   - Time-restricted eating windows

3. **Caffeine Management**
   - Avoid caffeine 6 hours before bed
   - Green tea/chai only morning-to-midday

4. **Evening Beverage Choices**
   - Hibiscus-lemon verbena (caffeine-free)
   - Water (but front-loaded earlier)

## Why No Traditional Sleep Foods?

"The How Not to Diet Cookbook" is focused on:
- **Weight loss through chronobiology** (timing)
- **21 Tweaks** for metabolic optimization
- **Recipes and meal planning**

It is NOT a comprehensive nutrition encyclopedia. The main "How Not to Diet" book might contain more detailed sleep food information, but this cookbook specifically focuses on practical recipes and timing strategies.

## File Naming Convention Used

All files created with lowercase-with-hyphens format:
- sufficient-sleep.json
- evening-fasting.json
- caffeine-timing-for-sleep.json
- regular-bedtime-schedule.json
- evening-hydration-timing.json
- circadian-rhythm-optimization.json
- hibiscus-lemon-verbena-blend.json

## ID Range

Started from food-166 (current highest in database was food-165)
Ended at food-172

Total: **7 new sleep/circadian-supporting entries**

## Recommendation

To extract traditional sleep foods (tart cherries, kiwi, chamomile, etc.), you would need:
1. The main "How Not to Diet" book (not the cookbook)
2. "How Not to Die" book
3. Scientific nutrition databases
4. NutritionFacts.org video transcripts

This cookbook simply doesn't cover those specific sleep-promoting foods.
