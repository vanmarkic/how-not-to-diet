The traditional Portuguese soup is made with dark greens,
potatoes and sliced sausage, but this elevated, healthier
version keeps the greens while swapping in butternut squash
for potatoes (though you can add potatoes, too, if you’d like*)
and replaces the sausage with red kidney beans.
1 red onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 butternut squash, halved, de-seeded and cut into ½-inch (1cm) dice (about
3½ cups/490g)
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 bay leaves
6 cups/1.5 litres Light Vegetable Broth ( here)
6 cups/220g chopped fresh kale, collards or other dark greens
1½ cups/265g cooked** or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free red
kidney beans, drained and rinsed
Super-Charged Spice Blend (here)
1 teaspoon white miso paste
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Heat ¼ cup/60ml water in a large pot over medium heat. Add the
onion, garlic, squash, oregano, red pepper flakes and bay leaves.
Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the Light Vegetable Broth and
bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook, partially
covered, until the vegetables are just tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in
the kale, kidney beans and Super-Charged Spice Blend to taste and
cook for 10 minutes longer.

¾ teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
½ teaspoon chopped fresh sage
Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend (here)
TO SERVE
3 cups/75g rocket
½ cup/15g fresh basil leaves, torn
FOR THE VEGETABLES:  Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7.
Line one or two large, rimmed roasting tins with silicone mats or
baking parchment.
In separate groups, evenly place all the vegetables, except the
tomatoes, in the prepared tin(s). Scatter the tomatoes over the piles
of vegetables. Roast in the oven, turning once, until the vegetables
are tender and nicely browned, about 10 minutes per side. Remove
from the oven and allow to cool to room temperature.
FOR THE DRESSING: In a blender, combine all the dressing ingredients,
adding Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend to taste, and blend until
smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed.
TO SERVE:  Spread the rocket on a large platter. Arrange the cooled
roasted vegetables in separate piles on top of the rocket and drizzle
with the dressing. Sprinkle the fresh basil on top and serve.

BENEFITS OF FIBRE ON MORTALITY
Can fibre consumption influence cardiovascular, cancer
and all-cause mortality? Those who ate the most fibre
had 23 per cent less cardiovascular disease mortality, 17
per cent lower risk of dying from cancer, and 23 per cent
lower mortality from all causes put together.54
Where is fibre found? Animal cells are encased only in
easily digestible membranes, but the walls of plant cells
are made out of fibre.
Looking for fibre? Look no further than whole, unrefined
plant foods.55

PORTOBELLOS AND SPINACH ON CAULIFLOWER
MASH WITH MISO–MUSHROOM SAUCE
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
I like to make the mash and sauce ahead of time, so I can put
dinner on the table in a flash.
CAULIFLOWER MASH
1 head cauliflower, trimmed and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
2 teaspoons Roasted Garlic (here) (optional)
SAUCE
2 shallots, finely chopped
2 cups/200g chopped assorted fresh mushrooms of your choice
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast

3 spring onions, coarsely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

=== PAGE 179 ===
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
Ground black pepper
6 cups/180g spinach leaves
TO SERVE
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
FOR THE CAULIFLOWER MASH: Steam the cauliflower in a steamer basket
over an inch or two (2.5–5cm) of boiling water until soft, about 10
minutes. Transfer to a bowl or a food processor and then add the
nutritional yeast, miso paste and Roasted Garlic (if using). Mash or
puree until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed. Keep
warm.
FOR THE SAUCE:  Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a saucepan over a
medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until soft, about 3 minutes.
Add the chopped mushrooms and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to soften.
Add the nutritional yeast, miso paste, vinegar, thyme, sage, onion
powder and black pepper to taste. Stir in the Light Vegetable Broth
and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to low and continue to simmer
for 5 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a blender or a food processor
and blend until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.
Return to the saucepan and keep warm.
FOR THE MUSHROOMS: Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or
heavy-based frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the mushroom
caps and cook for about 5 minutes. Add the spring onions, garlic,
vinegar, smoked paprika and black pepper to taste. Flip the
mushroom caps and continue to cook until the mushrooms are tender
and nicely browned on both sides, about 5 minutes longer. When the
portobellos are done cooking, push them to one side of the skillet, or
remove them from the skillet, if you prefer. Add the spinach to the
skillet and cook, tossing with tongs, until the greens are wilted. Return
the mushrooms to the skillet to heat through, if needed.

This tart is one of my go-to recipes when I want a delicious
way to use up leftover cooked whole grains. Any combination
works as well as the oat groats, quinoa and millet listed
below, so feel free to be creative.
8 ounces/225g mushrooms, chopped
1 red or yellow pepper, de-seeded and chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
9 ounces/250g chard or spinach, chopped
2 tablespoons Umami Sauce Redux (here)
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon dried thyme
Ground black pepper
½ cup/75g finely chopped red onion
1 celery stalk, finely chopped
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
1 tablespoon white miso paste
1 teaspoon dried marjoram
1½ cups/260g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free white
beans, drained and rinsed
1 cup/160g cold cooked* oat groats
1 cup/185g cold cooked* quinoa
1 cup/175g cold cooked* millet
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
3 spring onions, finely chopped

=== PAGE 251 ===
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
2 tablespoons ground walnuts
1 lemon, cut into wedges (optional)
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms, pepper and garlic and
cook until softened, stirring frequently, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
chard, Umami Sauce Redux, paprika, thyme and black pepper to
taste and cook for 3 minutes longer. Transfer to a bowl and set aside;
then return the skillet to the heat.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml water in the same skillet and add the onion and
celery. Cook over a medium heat until softened, about 5 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Stir in the nutritional yeast, flaxseeds, miso paste
and marjoram. Add the white beans and a little more water if needed,
so the ingredients don’t stick to the pan. Lower the heat to low and
cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and
set aside to cool. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.
Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor and blend until
smooth.
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6.
In a medium bowl, combine the cooked oat groats, quinoa and millet
along with the onion powder, garlic powder, spring onions and
parsley. Add about ¾ cup/175ml of the pureed white bean mixture
and mix well. Evenly press the mixture into the bottom and up the
sides of a deep-dish 9-inch/23cm pie plate to form the crust. Bake the
crust for 10 minutes; then remove from the oven and set aside.
Add the remaining bean mixture to the chard mixture and mix well.
Evenly spread the chard mixture over the crust. Sprinkle the top with
ground walnuts and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until nicely
browned.
Remove from the oven and let sit for at least 15 minutes before
slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature with lemon wedges (if

=== PAGE 252 ===
using).

MILLET RISOTTO WITH MUSHROOMS, WHITE
BEANS AND SPINACH
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Millet isn’t typically used to make risotto, but this recipe
proves this healthy grain creates a delicious, creamy and
savoury version.
3 cups/700ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
½ cup/75g finely chopped red onion
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 cup/200g uncooked millet
1 teaspoon white miso paste
2 cups/150g thinly sliced baby portobello mushrooms
1 cup/75g thinly sliced shiitake mushroom caps
1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
¼ cup/35g nutritional yeast
1½ cups/260g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free white
beans, drained and rinsed
3 cups/75g chopped fresh spinach
Ground black pepper
Balsamic Syrup (here)
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of the Light Vegetable Broth in a large saucepan or
deep skillet over a medium heat. Add the onion and cook for 5
minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in
the millet, miso paste, and the remaining broth. Bring just to the boil,
then lower the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, or until
the broth is absorbed and the millet is tender.

=== PAGE 255 ===
Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of water in a large skillet or heavy-
based frying pan over a medium-high heat. Add the baby portobello
and shiitake mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly
browned and softened, about 5 minutes. Add the vinegar and toss
gently to coat the mushrooms. Remove the skillet from the heat and
set aside.
When the millet is cooked, remove from the heat. Add the
mushrooms and stir in the nutritional yeast, white beans and spinach,
cover, and let stand for another 10 minutes.
Uncover and fluff the millet risotto with a fork. Spoon into shallow
bowls, sprinkle with black pepper to taste, and serve hot, drizzled with
Balsamic Syrup.

WHAT ABOUT MILLET?
Millet is a generic term applicable to many small grains,72
such as pearl millet, which most of us think of as millet.
But there are also proso, foxtail and finger millets, plus
dozens of others. Much of its starch may be resistant
starch that feeds the good bugs in our colon.73 Millet also
tends to have markedly slower stomach-emptying times
than other starchy foods such as white rice, boiled
potatoes or pasta.74

quick and easy way to have a hearty, flavoursome breakfast.
1 cup/180g oat groats
2 ripe bananas
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
