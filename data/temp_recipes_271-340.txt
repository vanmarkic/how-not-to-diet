TEFF AND BLACK LENTILS OVER BERBERE-
SPICED KALE
MAKES: 3 to 4 servings  DIFFICULTY: Moderate
Teff is a fine grain about the size of a poppy seed. Naturally
gluten-free and high in protein, it is a staple in many East
African dishes. And berbere? It is a traditional Ethiopian spice
blend available online or in well-stocked supermarkets. You
can also make your own using the recipe on here.
LENTILS
1 cup/200g dried black lentils
1 teaspoon Berbere Spice Blend (here)
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
TEFF
1 cup/195g uncooked teff
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
GREENS
1 cup/250ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
1 red onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tablespoons salt-free tomato puree
2 teaspoons Berbere Spice Blend (here)
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground coriander

=== PAGE 272 ===
1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free chopped tomatoes, undrained
8 cups/250g chopped kale or other dark leafy greens, tough stems removed
FOR THE LENTILS:  In a small saucepan, combine the lentils, Berbere
Spice Blend, onion powder and garlic powder. Add 2¼ cups/560ml of
water and bring to a simmer. Cover and continue to simmer over a
low heat until the lentils are tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes.
FOR THE TEFF: While the lentils are cooking, combine the teff,
nutritional yeast and miso paste in another small saucepan. Stir in 1¼
cups/310ml of water and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to low,
cover and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the teff is tender and the
water is absorbed. Fluff it with a fork, cover and set aside until ready
to serve.
FOR THE GREENS:  Heat ¼ cup/60ml of the Light Vegetable Broth in a
large skillet or heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Add the
onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
tomato puree, Berbere Spice Blend, paprika, coriander and tomatoes
with their juices and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer;
then add the kale and the remaining broth. Cook, stirring frequently ,
until the kale is tender and the flavours are combined, about 10
minutes.
TO SERVE:  Divide the greens among three to four shallow bowls, top
with the teff, followed by the lentils. Serve hot.
ARE ANCIENT GRAINS HEALTHIER?
Are ancient grains healthier than modern ones? Based
on vitamin and mineral concentrations, it’s pretty
similar,81 though primitive wheats have more antioxidant
capacity.82 Ancient wheat products do appear to
be anti-inflammatory and may improve blood sugar
control and cholesterol. The best available data suggest

=== PAGE 273 ===
they’re better, so if you have the choice, why not opt for
ancient varieties?

GRAIN-STUFFED PEPPERS WITH CHEESY
TOMATO SAUCE
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
This recipe calls for my beloved Basic BROL, the powerfully
healthy and delicious combination of barley, rye, oats, and
lentils, but any cooked whole grains may be used for the
stuffing.
PEPPERS
4 large red peppers
1 red onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, chopped
2 cups/360g Basic BROL (here), cooled, or other cooked* whole grains of your
choice
1½ cups/250g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free
chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
1 teaspoon white miso paste
¼ cup/35g nutritional yeast
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1½ cups/390g tomato puree
CHEESY TOMATO SAUCE
1 cup/175g cooked* or BPA-free tinned or Tetra Pak salt-free white beans,
drained and rinsed
⅓ cup/45g nutritional yeast

=== PAGE 276 ===
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons white miso paste
½ teaspoon salt-free yellow mustard
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 (¼-inch/5mm) piece fresh turmeric, grated, or ¼ teaspoon ground
½ cup/130g tomato puree
FOR THE PEPPERS: Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5.
Cut off the top ½ inch/1cm of the peppers and set the tops aside.
Remove the seeds from the pepper cavities and set the peppers
aside. Chop the reserved pepper tops after discarding the stems.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium-high heat. Add the chopped pepper tops, onion, and
garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened,
about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the cooked and cooled Basic BROL,
chickpeas, ground flaxseeds, miso paste, nutritional yeast, parsley ,
smoked paprika and black pepper. Stir in the cooked vegetables and
½ cup/130g of the tomato puree and mix well.
Fill the pepper cavities with the stuffing mixture. Arrange the stuffed
peppers standing upright and next to one another in a baking dish.
Pour the remaining tomato puree and ¼ cup/60ml of water around
the peppers. Cover tightly and place in the oven. Bake for about 45
minutes, or until the peppers are soft and the stuffing is hot.
FOR THE CHEESY TOMATO SAUCE: While the peppers bake, make the
sauce. Combine all the sauce ingredients, except the tomato puree,
in a high-powered blender. Process until smooth, scraping down the
sides as needed. Add the tomato puree and blend again. If the sauce
is too thick, add a little water, 2 tablespoons at a time, until the sauce

=== PAGE 277 ===
is smooth. Transfer the sauce to a saucepan and warm gently over a
medium-low heat, stirring, to heat through. Taste and adjust the
seasonings, if needed. Keep warm.
TO SERVE:  When ready to serve, place each stuffed pepper upright on
a serving plate or shallow serving bowl and top with the Cheesy
Tomato Sauce.

GREEN TEA QUINOA AND PEAS WITH ROASTED
ASPARAGUS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Inspired by the Japanese dish known as ochazuke  (white rice
steeped in green tea), this version uses quinoa instead of rice
and pairs with roasted asparagus. Top with toasted nori and
sesame seeds for even more texture and flavour.
3 green tea bags
3 cups/750ml hot water
1 pound/450g asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces
1 cup/170g uncooked quinoa, well rinsed and drained
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 cup/150g frozen peas
½ cup/75g finely chopped spring onions
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
Ground black pepper
1 lemon, cut into wedges
Place the tea bags in a bowl with the hot water. Steep the tea for 8 to
10 minutes, then remove and discard the tea bags. Set the brewed
tea aside.
Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line a large, rimmed
baking tray with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Spread the asparagus pieces on the prepared baking tray. Roast in
the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned on

=== PAGE 280 ===
the edges. Set aside.
Combine the quinoa, garlic, ginger and steeped tea in a medium
saucepan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, cover,
and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the peas, cover, and cook for
another 5 minutes, or until the tea is absorbed and the quinoa and
peas are cooked. Remove from the heat and stir in the spring onions
and asparagus.
To serve, spoon the quinoa into serving bowls and top with sesame
seeds and black pepper. Serve with lemon wedges.
QUINOA AND TRIGLYCERIDES
Quinoa is a seed-like fruit high in protein,83 vitamins,
magnesium, iron, and zinc.84 About a cup a day of
cooked quinoa for twelve weeks led to a 36 per cent
drop in triglycerides, comparable to what one gets with
triglycerides-lowering drugs or high-dose fish oil
supplements.85

BARLEY-STUFFED CABBAGE ROLLS

=== PAGE 282 ===
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
Barley and cabbage go together like peanut butter and jam.
These stuffed cabbage rolls are sure to become a favourite!
TOMATO SAUCE
½ cup/75g chopped onion
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 teaspoons white miso paste
2 (400g) BPA-free tins or Tetra Paks salt-free finely chopped tomatoes
¼ cup/35g nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
¼ cup/4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Ground black pepper
FILLING

2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
¼ cup/4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
Ground black pepper
CABBAGE
1 large head red cabbage

=== PAGE 283 ===
FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE:  Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large saucepan
over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
miso paste, tomatoes, nutritional yeast, oregano, basil, parsley and
black pepper to taste. Lower the heat to low, cover, and cook until the
flavours are well blended, about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the
seasonings, if needed. Set aside.
FOR THE FILLING:  In a bowl, combine all the filling ingredients and mix
well. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5.
FOR THE CABBAGE:  Trim the cabbage of any damaged leaves and use a
sharp knife to cut out the core. Place the cabbage, cut side down, in a
large pot along with enough water to cover, and then bring to the boil.
Cook until the leaves soften and begin to unfold, about 10 minutes.
Use tongs to remove the leaves as soon as they soften and carefully
place them on a plate to cool. Continue until you have at least 12
cooked leaves.
One at a time, arrange the leaves on a cutting board with the stem
end nearest you. Place about ¼ cup/4 of filling at the stem end. Fold
the stem end and sides over the filling and roll the cabbage leaf up
tightly. Continue until all the cabbage rolls have been made.
TO ASSEMBLE AND SERVE:  Spread half of the sauce onto the bottom of a
large, shallow baking dish. Arrange the cabbage rolls, seam side
down, on top of the sauce. Spoon all but 1 cup of sauce over the
cabbage rolls, and then cover the rolls with 3 to 4 leftover leaves.
Spoon the remaining sauce over the leaves. Cover the baking dish
tightly and bake for 45 minutes, or until the rolls are tender. Serve hot.

BREAKFAST
Is breakfast the most important meal of the day? Well, according to
chronobiology, the study of how our body’s natural cycles – mental,
physical and emotional – are affected by the rhythms of the sun,
moon and seasons, it seems that it is when it comes to losing
weight.
Calories eaten in the morning seem to be less fattening than calories
eaten in the evening. More calories are burned off in the morning
due to diet-induced thermogenesis, the amount of energy the body
takes to digest and process a meal, given off in part as waste heat.
When people consume the exact same meal in the morning,
afternoon, and at night, their body uses up about 25 per cent more
calories to process the meal in the afternoon than at night and about

=== PAGE 286 ===
50 per cent more calories to digest it in the morning.86 That leaves
fewer net calories in the morning to be stored as fat.
These bright, bountiful breakfast recipes will help you heed the
proverb ‘Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like
a pauper’ and take advantage of the metabolic benefits to distributing
more calories to earlier in the day.

CEREAL OR OATMEAL?
After eating Honey Nut Cheerios, study participants felt
significantly hungrier than after the same calories of
oatmeal. Food structure, not just nutrient composition,
may be critical for optimal health.87 Rolled oats, for
instance, have a lower glycemic index than instant
oatmeal,88 and oat flakes cause lower blood sugar and
insulin spikes than powdered oats.89 Different forms of
the same ingredient can have different effects.

ARE MICROWAVE OVENS SAFE?
A famous radio telescope scan-ning the cosmos for

SLOW COOKER APPLE PIE OAT GROATS

=== PAGE 309 ===
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Waking up to the sweet, rich aroma of this apple pie-inspired
groatmeal is a great inducement to getting out of bed in the
morning. This dish needs about eight hours for the oat groats
to soak and another eight hours for the groatmeal to cook in a
slow cooker, so plan ahead. The effort is minimal, and the
time is very well worth it.
1 cup/180g oat groats, soaked for about 8 hours in water and then drained
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 apple, cored and grated with its peel
Optional toppings: goji berries, Date Syrup (here), ground cinnamon, dried or
fresh fruit, or sliced or chopped nuts
In a 3.8 litre (or larger) slow cooker, combine the drained soaked oat
groats with the chia seeds and cinnamon, stirring to mix well. Add the
grated apple and 2¾ cups/675ml of water and stir to combine. Put the
lid on the slow cooker and cook on low for about 8 hours. Stir the
cooked groatmeal before spooning into serving bowls. Sprinkle with
your desired toppings and serve.
DON’T PEEL YOUR APPLES
Eating just one apple a day is associated with a 35 per
cent lower risk of dying from all causes.92 Flavonoids,
phytonutrients concentrated in the skins of apples, may
play a role by improving artery function,93 so don’t peel
your apples!

FRUIT
When study participants were randomized to a diet low in all sugars,
even the naturally occurring sugars in fruit, they did worse than those
randomized to cut down just added sugars. Those who retained fruit
in their diet lost nearly 50 per cent more weight.94
Fruit can actually facilitate weight loss. What’s more, increasing
consumption of fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of three of
our leading causes of death – heart disease, stroke and high blood
pressure – and may help protect us from cancer, our other top
killer.95 So, pick up an apple, peel a banana, bite into a juicy peach,
throw back a handful of blueberries, and get creative with these
flavoursome fruity recipes.

SYRUP
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Make this quick and easy treat at the peak of berry season. I
like to combine several different berries, but it’s also delicious
with just one or two types, if you prefer. This recipe serves
four, but if you’re making it for just one or two people, cut
back on the amount of berries and/or only add the mint leaves
and balsamic when ready to serve.
⅓ cup/75ml chocolate balsamic vinegar or Balsamic Syrup (here)
1½ cups/225g strawberries, hulled and halved
¾ cup/95g raspberries
1 cup/100g blueberries
½ cup/75g blackberries
2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves
1 tablespoon cacao nibs
¼ cup/30g coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)
If not using Balsamic Syrup, pour the chocolate balsamic vinegar into
a small saucepan and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, or
until reduced by about one-third. Remove from the heat and set the
vinegar aside to cool to room temperature before using.
In a large serving bowl, combine all the berries with the mint leaves.
Spoon into individual glass serving bowls and drizzle on the
chocolate balsamic reduction or Balsamic Syrup. Top with the cacao
nibs and nuts (if using).

BENEFITS OF BLUEBERRIES ON HEART
DISEASE AND CHOLESTEROL
Four out of five studies suggest that increased intake of
berries, with their brightly coloured pigments called
anthocyanins, is significantly associated with a reduction
in risk of coronary heart disease, our number one killer,
by 12 to 32 per cent.96
What do berries have to do with

stone fruits, such as cherries, plums, peaches, nectarines,
mangoes and dates, are in season in late summer.
3 tablespoons ground chia seeds
1½ cups/260g fresh or thawed frozen diced mango
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 pitted soft dates, soaked for 10 minutes in hot water and then drained
3 ripe apricots, pitted and quartered
3 ripe plums, pitted and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces
2 ripe peaches or nectarines, pitted and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces
2 cups/450g pitted cherries
In a small bowl, combine the chia seeds and ¼ cup/60ml of water and
mix well. Set aside for 10 minutes to thicken.
In a food processor or blender, combine the mango, lemon juice,
dates and the chia mixture and process until smooth. Divide equally
among four small glass dessert bowls. Cover and refrigerate until
firm, 4 hours or overnight.
Combine the apricots, plums, peaches, and cherries in a large bowl.
Toss gently to combine.
To serve, spoon the fruit evenly over the chilled mango mixture.
Serve immediately.

1 cup/125g fresh or thawed frozen raspberries
1 cup/175g fresh or thawed frozen diced mango
4 tablespoons ground chia seeds
Optional garnishes: diced mango, fresh raspberries, sunflower seeds or
pumpkin seeds
In a high-powered blender, combine the raspberries, mango, and ½

refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Serve as is or topped with garnish
of choice.
IS MELAMINE SAFE?
Melamine, used to make inexpensive, hard plastic
kitchenware, isn’t suitable for microwaves and cooking,98
but what about for just eating or drinking? Exposure to
the
chemical compound is significantly associated with
kidney function deterioration in patients with early-stage
chronic kidney disease,99 so I’d skip melamine
altogether.

BAKED APPLES WITH WALNUTS AND GOJI
BERRIES
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
These luscious baked apples taste like apple pie, but aren’t
bogged down with added sugar, flour and fat. Another bonus
is how great your house will smell while they’re baking.
3 tablespoons goji berries, soaked in warm water for 15 minutes and then
drained
⅓ cup/40g chopped walnuts
1 tablespoon Date Syrup (here)
1½ teaspoons ground cinnamon
4 large, firm baking apples, washed and cored
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.
Place the goji berries in a food processor and add the walnuts, Date
Syrup and cinnamon; then pulse until well mixed. Set aside.
Peel the top third of each apple. Rub the exposed part of the apples
with the lemon juice to prevent discoloration. Stuff about 2
tablespoons of the goji mixture into the centre of each apple and
arrange the apples upright in a small, shallow baking dish. Pour ½
cup/120ml of water around the apples. Cover and bake until tender ,
about 1 hour. Serve warm.

TROPICAL SMOOTHIE BOWLS

=== PAGE 326 ===
MAKES: 2 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Satisfying, delicious and versatile, smoothie bowls are thick
smoothies you can eat with a spoon. This is the ultimate
customizable dish: change up the fruits to suit your own taste
and use whichever toppings you prefer. Smoothie bowls are
especially good for breakfast or dessert. I like to keep banana
chunks in my freezer so I always have them on hand. Frozen
mango and pineapple, readily available in supermarkets, are
convenient and often less expensive than fresh.
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
2 ripe bananas, peeled, cut into chunks and frozen
1 cup/175g diced fresh or frozen mango
1 cup/200g diced fresh or frozen pineapple
Optional toppings: goji berries, sliced banana, berries, cacao nibs, ground
flaxseeds or hemp seeds
Combine the ground chia seeds and ½ cup/120ml of water in a bowl
and set aside for 10 minutes to thicken.
In a blender, combine the bananas, mango and pineapple. Add the
chia seed mixture and blend until smooth.
Divide the smoothie mixture between two bowls. Add any desired
toppings and serve.

GINGER ROASTED PEARS

=== PAGE 328 ===
MAKES: 2 to 4 servings  DIFFICULTY: Easy
Roasted pears are easy to prepare and a lovely finish to a
meal. For an extra flourish, garnish with a sprinkling of cacao
nibs or crushed pistachios.
2 large ripe pears
1 tablespoon Date Syrup (here)
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground ginger
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.
Cut the pears in half lengthways. Use a melon baller or a measuring
spoon to scoop out the seeds. Place the pear halves, cut side up, on
a rimmed baking tray.
In a small bowl, combine the Date Syrup and lemon juice and mix
until well combined. (You may want to microwave the Date Syrup and
lemon juice for 10 to 15 seconds so they blend more easily.)
Rub the cut side of each pear with the date mixture, then sprinkle with
the ground ginger. Roast the pears in the oven for 30 minutes, or until
just tender. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly before
serving.
GROUND GINGER AND MUSCLE PAIN
Does ginger help with muscle pain? Apparently not
acutely, so you can’t just take it as you would a drug, but
it may attenuate the day-to-day progression of muscle
pain.100 A teaspoon or two for a couple of days or weeks

may reduce muscle pain and soreness as well as
accelerate recovery of muscular strength.101

MUSHROOM–WALNUT CRUMBLES
MAKES: 2 cups/250g  DIFFICULTY: Easy
These crumbles add tremendous texture and flavour.
Sprinkle them on top of cooked whole grains and vegetables,
or add them to stuffing and pasta. The savoury flavour is
similar to Italian sausage. For a spicy kick, add ½ teaspoon
of red pepper flakes and use the optional cayenne.
6 ounces/175g baby portobello mushrooms
½ cup/60g walnut pieces
⅓ cup/45g raw sunflower seeds
⅓ cup/45g raw pumpkin seeds
¼ cup/30g ground flaxseeds
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground fennel seeds
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon cayenne (optional)
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
Pulse the mushrooms in a food processor until finely chopped.
Transfer to a bowl and set aside.

=== PAGE 334 ===
In the same food processor (no need to wipe it out), combine the
walnuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds and pulse to coarsely
grind. Add the ground nuts and seeds to the bowl of finely chopped
mushrooms. Add all the remaining ingredients. Mix well.
Heat a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat.
Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, or until the
mushroom liquid has been released and evaporated, and crumbles
begin to form. Cook a few minutes longer, until the crumbles begin to
crisp. Remove from the heat and allow to cool. Use the crumbles
immediately in recipes, or store them in an airtight container in the
refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.
For Variation:  Substitute cold cooked whole grains (barley is a good
choice) or grated cauliflower for the mushrooms.
BASIC BROL (BARLEY, RYE, OATS AND LENTILS)
MAKES: 5 cups/900g  DIFFICULTY: Easy
BROL stands for barley, rye, oats and lentils. Barley groats,
sold as pot or hull-less barley, rye grains, and oat groats are
available in well-stocked supermarkets or online. Use purple
barley, if you can find it, for the extra antioxidant boost. For
the same reason, I use black lentils because they are the
most antioxidant-packed lentils. Sometimes sold as beluga
lentils due to their resemblance to caviar, you can also find
black lentils in well-stocked supermarkets or online. For a
gluten-free version of my Basic BROL, use gluten-free oats
and substitute sorghum and millet for the rye and barley
(SMOL!). Finger millet is one of the healthiest types. For
convenience, you may want to cook your whole grains and

=== PAGE 335 ===
lentils in larger proportions, then portion and freeze them for
future use.
½ cup/100g dried black lentils, rinsed
½ cup/100g pot barley, rinsed
½ cup/85g rye grains, rinsed
½ cup/90g oat groats, rinsed
In an electric pressure cooker or multicooker, such as an Instant Pot,
pressure-cook the lentils in 1 cup/250ml of water on high. (I use the
Steam setting.) Allow time for natural pressure release so the
remaining water gets absorbed. Remove the cooked lentils from the
pot and set aside.
Combine the barley, rye and oat groats in the cooker. Stir in 3
cups/750ml of water. Pressure cook for 30 minutes, or use the Mixed
Grain button if your cooker has one.
Add the cooked lentils to the cooked grains and toss gently to
combine. The Basic BROL is now ready to use in recipes. You can
also portion and freeze to use as needed.
For Variation:  If you prefer to cook your whole grains on the stovetop,
cook them separately, or cook them in larger amounts. Turn to the
Legumes and Grains Cooking Charts  here for instruction, if needed.
FRESH TOMATO SALSA
MAKES: 3 cups/500g  DIFFICULTY: Easy
Salsa is simple to make and especially delicious when fresh
tomatoes are in season. Best of all, you can have it your way

=== PAGE 336 ===
without the added salt and other ingredients often found in
commercial salsas.
6 firm plum tomatoes, cored and coarsely chopped
½ pepper of any colour, de-seeded and finely chopped
2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
1 jalapeño pepper or other small hot chilli, de-seeded and finely chopped
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander or parsley
Super-Charged Spice Blend (here)
Combine all the ingredients, including the Super-Charged Spice
Blend to taste, in a bowl and stir to combine. Cover and let stand at
room temperature for 1 hour before serving. If not using right away ,
store in an airtight container in the refrigerator. The salsa will keep
refrigerated for 3 to 4 days.
BRAZIL NUT PARM
MAKES: 1½ cups/200g DIFFICULTY: Easy
I store this topping in a glass shaker with large holes and a
tight-fitting lid so I can easily sprinkle it onto pasta and whole-
grain dishes or salads for a cheesy flavour. Although the
recipe calls for Brazil nuts and cashews, I sometimes mix it
up and substitute other varieties of nuts. Experiment
creatively and enjoy!
¾ cup/100g raw Brazil nuts
¼ cup/40g raw cashews

=== PAGE 337 ===
½ cup/70g nutritional yeast
2 teaspoons Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend ( here)
Combine all the ingredients in a food processor and process until the
nuts are finely ground. Transfer to a covered container or shaker with
a tight-fitting lid and keep refrigerated. The Brazil Nut Parm will keep
for up to 1 week in the refrigerator or 1 month in the freezer.
BERBERE SPICE BLEND
MAKES: ⅓ cup/100g DIFFICULTY: Easy
Because this spice blend features several spices, it’s more
economical to buy a small amount of the various spices sold
in bulk, if available. You can also buy ready-made berbere in
spice shops, ethnic markets or online.
3 tablespoons paprika
1 tablespoon cayenne, or to taste
2 teaspoons ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon ground cardamom
½ teaspoon ground fenugreek seeds
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
⅛ teaspoon ground cloves
⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon

=== PAGE 338 ===
⅛ teaspoon ground allspice
Combine all the ingredients in a spice grinder or small food
processor and grind finely to mix well. Transfer the spice mixture to a
small jar with a tight-fitting lid and store in a cool, dry place.
SUPER-CHARGED SPICE BLEND
MAKES: ⅔ cup/50g DIFFICULTY: Easy
Similar to Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend from The How
Not to Die Cookbook, included in this collection on here, this
super-charged spice blend boasts the added benefits of
cumin, nigella seeds, ginger and black pepper. I always have
this seasoning blend on hand to boost flavours or to use in
place of salt.
¼ cup/35g nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 teaspoons ground thyme
2 teaspoons mustard powder
2 teaspoons paprika
2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon ground nigella seeds
1 teaspoon ground ginger
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
½ teaspoon celery seeds

=== PAGE 339 ===
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
Combine all the ingredients in a spice grinder to mix well and
pulverize the dried herbs. Transfer the mixture to a shaker bottle with
a tight-fitting lid. Store in a cool, dry place.
DR GREGER’S SPECIAL SPICE BLEND
MAKES: ½ cup/120g  DIFFICULTY: Easy
For those times when your food needs seasoning without the
flavour of cumin, here’s my original spice blend recipe from
The How Not to Die Cookbook .
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon dried parsley
1 tablespoon dried basil
2 teaspoons ground thyme
2 teaspoons garlic powder
2 teaspoons mustard powder
2 teaspoons paprika
½ teaspoon ground turmeric
½ teaspoon celery seeds

pulverize the dried herbs. Transfer the mixture to a shaker bottle with
a tight-fitting lid. Store in a cool, dry place.
UMAMI SAUCE REDUX

=== PAGE 340 ===
MAKES: 1¼ cups/300ml DIFFICULTY: Easy
Umami is one of the five basic tastes, though many people
are only learning about it now. The word was created by a
Japanese chemist named Kikunae Ikeda from umai, which
means ‘delicious’, and mi, which means ‘taste’. This new and
improved umami sauce is perfect in sautés or stir-fries to
boost flavour without adding the sodium of salt or soy sauce.
1 cup/250ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1 teaspoon grated ginger
1½ tablespoons treacle
1 teaspoon salt-free tomato puree
½ teaspoon ground black pepper
2 teaspoons miso paste blended into 2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
Heat the Light Vegetable Broth in a small saucepan over a medium
heat. Add the garlic and ginger and simmer for 3 minutes. Stir in the
treacle, tomato puree and black pepper, and bring just to the boil.
Lower the heat to low and simmer for 1 minute. Remove from the
heat, and then stir in the miso mixture, apple cider vinegar and
lemon juice. Blend well. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.
Allow the sauce to cool before transferring to a jar or bottle with a
tight-fitting lid. The sauce will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1
week. Alternatively, pour the cooled sauce into an ice cube tray and
freeze into individual portions.
