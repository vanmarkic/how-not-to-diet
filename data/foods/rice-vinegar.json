It has a gentler, less acidic taste compared to white or apple cider vinegar, making it ideal for delicate grain salads and Asian-inspired dressings. Like all vinegars, it provides metabolic benefits for weight loss when consumed with meals. Its subtle flavor pairs particularly well with quinoa, miso, and Asian vegetables.",
