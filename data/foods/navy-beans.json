They benefit excess body weight, insulin resistance, high cholesterol, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Their abundant resistant starch feeds beneficial gut bacteria and lowers the insulin response, supporting metabolic health and meeting the Daily Dozen's three daily servings of legumes for cardiovascular protection.",
