  "benefits": "Yacon syrup is a natural sweetener derived from the yacon root that contains prebiotic fructooligosaccharides. Unlike regular sugar or honey, it has a minimal glycemic impact and supports beneficial gut bacteria. The FOS in yacon syrup is not fully digested, providing sweetness with fewer absorbed calories. It's recommended as a healthier alternative for sweetening tea or other beverages.",
