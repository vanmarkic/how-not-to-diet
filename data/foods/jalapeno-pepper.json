  "benefits": "Jalapeño peppers activate brown adipose tissue (BAT), which burns calories to generate heat. The capsaicin in jalapeños triggers thermogenesis, increasing metabolic rate and fat burning. BAT activation is a powerful weight-loss mechanism that turns white fat into metabolically active brown fat. Can be sliced thinly or chopped finely to reduce heat while maintaining benefits.",

      "Alternately, for BAT activation, you can add one raw jalapeño pepper or ½ teaspoon of red pepper powder (or, presumably, crushed red pepper flakes) into your daily diet. To help beat the heat, you can very thinly slice or finely chop the jalapeño to reduce its bite to little prickles, or mix the red pepper into soup."
