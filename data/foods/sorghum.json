  "benefits": "Sorghum is an ancient whole grain that provides fiber-encased calories which blunts glycemic impact and insulin response. As an intact grain, the cell walls activate the ileal brake that dials down appetite and delivers sustenance to friendly gut flora. Being gluten-free, it is suitable for those with celiac disease.",
