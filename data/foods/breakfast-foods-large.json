  "benefits": "Due to circadian rhythms, the same calories eaten at breakfast are less fattening than when eaten at dinner. Front-loading calories by eating a larger breakfast optimizes metabolism and reduces fat storage. This aligns eating with the body's natural circadian patterns for better weight management.",
