  "benefits": "Thylakoids are chloroplast membranes found in all green leaves that act as fat blockers. They slow down fat digestion by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, allowing fats to travel further down the digestive tract. This triggers the ileal brake - a powerful satiety mechanism that releases appetite-suppressing hormones. Eating low-oxalate greens daily provides these fat-blocking thylakoids naturally, without need for supplements.",
