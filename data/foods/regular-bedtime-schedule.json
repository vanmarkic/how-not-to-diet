  "benefits": "Maintaining a regular bedtime schedule is essential for circadian rhythm optimization and weight management. Going to bed at the same time each night entrains the body's internal clock, improving sleep quality and metabolic function. Irregular sleep schedules disrupt circadian rhythms, leading to metabolic dysfunction and increased fat storage. A consistent bedtime works synergistically with the 7-hour sleep minimum and evening fasting to maximize weight-loss benefits.",
