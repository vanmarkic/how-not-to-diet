      "They're found out in the fields as oat groats and then have their inedible outer husks removed during processing. Groats can then be sliced into two to four pieces to make steel-cut (also known as pinhead or Irish) oats",
      "we could optimize that meal for weight loss by making the oatmeal from steel-cut or whole groats rather than rolled or instant"
