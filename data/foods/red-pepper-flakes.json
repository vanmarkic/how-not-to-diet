  "benefits": "Red pepper flakes activate brown adipose tissue (BAT), turning white fat into metabolically active brown fat that burns calories to generate heat. The capsaicin triggers thermogenesis, significantly increasing metabolic rate and fat oxidation. This is a convenient, shelf-stable way to get BAT-activating compounds daily. Can be easily mixed into soups, stews, or vegetable dishes.",
