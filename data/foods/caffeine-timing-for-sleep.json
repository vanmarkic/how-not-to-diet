  "benefits": "Avoiding caffeine within 6 hours of bedtime is essential for sleep quality and circadian rhythm optimization. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, interfering with natural sleep signals and melatonin production. While caffeinated beverages like green tea and chai tea offer metabolic benefits earlier in the day, consuming them too close to bedtime disrupts sleep architecture and reduces the restorative benefits of sleep, which are critical for weight management.",
