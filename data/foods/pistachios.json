  "benefits": "Pistachios show theoretical promise for weight loss through circadian synchronization. They naturally contain melatonin and other compounds that may help regulate sleep-wake cycles and metabolism. Eating pistachios in-shell naturally slows consumption rate, increasing satiety. While promising, this mechanism hasn't been sufficiently tested in clinical trials yet. As with all nuts, they should be eaten raw and whole rather than processed into butters for optimal weight-loss benefits.",
