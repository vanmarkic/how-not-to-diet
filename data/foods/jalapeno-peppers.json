      "Alternately, for BAT activation, you can add one raw jalapeño pepper or ½ teaspoon of red pepper powder (or, presumably, crushed red pepper flakes) into your daily diet. To help beat the heat, you can very thinly slice or finely chop the jalapeño to reduce its bite to little prickles, or mix the red pepper into soup or the whole food vegetable smoothie featured in one of my cooking videos on NutritionFacts.org."
