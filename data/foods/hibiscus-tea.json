  "benefits": "Hibiscus tea is rich in anthocyanins and powerful antioxidants that support weight loss and cardiovascular health. Unlike some teas, it can be consumed during meals without interfering with nutrient absorption. When mixed 6:1 with lemon verbena, it creates a synergistic blend. Hibiscus has been shown to support healthy blood pressure and may help with fat metabolism.",
