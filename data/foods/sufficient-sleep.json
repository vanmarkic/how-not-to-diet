  "benefits": "Getting sufficient sleep is one of the essential weight-loss boosters in the 21 Tweaks. Sleep deprivation disrupts metabolic hormones, increases appetite, and makes the same foods more fattening. Consistent sleep of at least 7 hours at a regular bedtime supports circadian rhythm optimization, which is crucial for weight management. Sleep quality and duration affect how calories are processed - the same food eaten with insufficient sleep translates into more body fat than when well-rested.",
