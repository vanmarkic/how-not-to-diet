  "benefits": "The hibiscus-lemon verbena blend (6 parts hibiscus to 1 part lemon verbena) is an ideal evening beverage choice because it's caffeine-free and won't disrupt sleep. Unlike green tea and chai tea, which must be avoided within 6 hours of bedtime, this herbal blend can be enjoyed at dinner or in the evening. The calming properties of lemon verbena combined with the antioxidant-rich hibiscus provide metabolic benefits without sleep interference. This makes it perfect for supporting both circadian rhythm optimization and adequate hydration in the evening hours.",
