  "benefits": "Saffron has clinical evidence supporting its use for weight loss through appetite suppression and mood enhancement. It works similarly to cumin but through different mechanisms. Saffron may help reduce snacking and emotional eating by improving mood and satiety signals. However, it's significantly more expensive than cumin, making cumin the more practical daily choice for most people.",
