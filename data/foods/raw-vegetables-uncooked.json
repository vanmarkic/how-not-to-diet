  "benefits": "Uncooked vegetables provide more orosensory stimulation than cooked ones, requiring more chewing and slowing eating rate. This helps trigger natural satiety signals by extending meal duration beyond 20 minutes. The intact cell structure means more calories remain trapped and unavailable for absorption. Raw vegetables also preserve heat-sensitive nutrients and enzymes. Prioritize above-ground vegetables highest on the water scale for maximum satiation with minimum calories.",

      "FOLLOW THE TWENTY-MINUTE RULE: Whether through increasing viscosity or the number of chews or decreasing bite size and eating rate, dozens of studies have demonstrated that no matter how we boost the amount of time food is in our mouths, it can result in lower caloric intake. Think bulkier, harder, chewier foods in smaller, well-chewed bites."
