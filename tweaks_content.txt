Here is the Daily Dozen and the number of servings
I recommend for each one. For years, I had this list
on a little dry-erase board on our refrigerator. Feel
free to cut this one out (or make your own copy) and
do the same. It’s also useful to take with you when
you go shopping to guide you through your
healthiest choices. And remember, it’s just about
doing your best. There are times, especially when I
am travelling, that I only hit a quarter of my goals.
When that happens, I just try to make up for it the
next day. The same goes for you: If one day you
only get a few of these foods into your diet, the next
day, do your best to get more!
Ironically, the second major complaint we got is that it doesn’t have
enough calories. I had to explain that the Daily Dozen just
represented the minimum I encourage people to eat, not the
maximum, and that, certainly, training athletes requiring thousands
more calories would have to eat much more. This all got me thinking,
though. Too much food but too few calories?  Sounds like the perfect
weight-loss diet!
The Daily Dozen is by definition all Green Light foods, all whole
plant foods, so that right there bakes in all seventeen of the ideal
weight-loss diet ingredients listed on here. What about the calorie
count? A systematic review of successful weight-loss strategies
concluded that given the metabolic slowing and increased appetite
that accompanies weight loss, to achieve significant weight loss,
calorie counts may need to drop as low as 1,200 calories a day for

================================================================================
PAGE 17
================================================================================
women and 1,500 calories a day for men.9 I set up a spreadsheet and
tried a bunch of common foods in each of the categories, and what
do you know: the Daily Dozen averages about 1,200 calories, with
the higher-calorie food choices nailing 1,500 calories.
GREEN LIGHT FOR WEIGHT LOSS
How is my Green Light category in How Not to Die different from my
recommendation in How Not to Diet to wall off your calories, to
ensure your protein, carbs, and fat are trapped within cell walls? After
all, only plants have cell walls. (Animals are made up of cells with
fluid membranes, requiring bones to hold them up, whereas plants
have rigid cell walls made out of fibre.) So, isn’t walling off calories
the same as choosing whole plant foods? The difference becomes
apparent with examples of formless foods, such as powdered whole
grains. Imagine a whole-grain wheat cereal with one ingredient: 100%
whole wheat. Or almond butter with one ingredient: almonds. Green
Light, right? Plant foods from which nothing bad has been added and
nothing good has been taken away. But now we know something
good has been taken away: the structure.
Eating whole grains is good, but eating whole-grain kernels is
better. Former Harvard nutrition chair Walter Willett has argued that
the term whole grain  should probably be reserved for only whole,
intact grain kernels.10 So, eat the wholiest of grains: intact grains,
also known as groats.
Take oats, for example. They’re found out in the fields as oat groats
and then have their inedible outer husks removed during
processing.11 Groats can then be sliced into two to four pieces to
make steel-cut (also known as pinhead or Irish) oats, coarsely ground
into Scottish oatmeal, or steamed and flattened into ‘old-fashioned’
rolled oats.12 Quick-cooking oats are just old-fashioned oats rolled
even thinner, and instant oats are steamed longer and rolled even
more thinly.13 Then, at the bottom of the list, the most processed
would be powdered oats, which you might find in oat-based breakfast

================================================================================
PAGE 18
================================================================================
cereals. Instead of buying boxed breakfast cereals, make oatmeal out
of whole, intact oats. They’re gr-r-oat!
With all the new data on the importance of food form, I’m starting to
sour on flour, so I advise not living by bread alone. The new structure
created by the pasta-making process can mediate these effects,
though, so you don’t have to say basta to pasta.
OPTIMIZING THE DAILY DOZEN FOR WEIGHT LOSS
A typical Green Light foods breakfast that would check off a few of
the Daily Dozen boxes would be a big bowl of oatmeal sweetened
with raisins. On the basis of what we learned in the Low in Calorie
Density, High in Water-Rich Foods, Eating Rate, and Wall Off Your
Calories sections of How Not to Diet, though, we could optimize that
meal for weight loss by making the oatmeal from steel-cut or whole
groats rather than rolled or instant, cooking it thick, and switching the
dried fruit for fresh – for example, swapping in strawberries for the
raisins. If we did want to use dried, as we learned in the Amping
AMPK and Inflammation Quenchers sections, barberries or gojis
might be a better choice.
Similarly, when choosing vegetables, we can steer toward
aboveground veggies highest on the water scale. Peppers have that
nicotine edge I described in Amping AMPK, and uncooked
vegetables in general offer more orosensory stimulation. If you want
to go underground, on the basis of what we learned about glycemic
load, sweet potatoes would be preferable to white. We certainly want
to mix it up, though, to take advantage of our built-in striving for
variety, and since vegetables represent the healthiest class of foods
with the fewest calories, we should aim to eat them earlier in the
meal.
In the Appetite Suppression section, we learned yet another reason
to include ground flaxseeds in our daily diet. Nuts are a great
complement to greens to boost the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients,
but, ideally, they should be eaten raw and whole or coarsely chopped
rather than blended into butters. This is not to say something like

================================================================================
PAGE 19
================================================================================
almond butter or tahini is unhealthy by any stretch, but for weight-loss
acceleration, structurally intact nuts and seeds would be better .
TWENTY-ONE TWEAKS TO
ACCELERATE WEIGHT LOSS
Offering maximum nutrition with minimum calories, a diet centered on
whole, healthy plant foods is the best form of girth control. Whole
food, plant-based nutrition best checks off the criteria for the optimal
slimming diet. It’s the tried-and-true recipe with the most ideal weight-
loss diet ingredients – so why wasn’t that the end of How Not to Diet?
Just eating healthfully enough should do it. Obese individuals
randomized to eat plant-based at home lose nearly a cubic inch of
deep visceral belly fat a week.14 Start packing your diet with real food
that grows out of the ground, and the pounds should come off
naturally, taking you down toward your ideal weight. The average
person eating completely plant-based has a body mass index (BMI)
down around the perfect range,15 but there is a bell curve. Even if the
average is on target, some people naturally fall to either side, so I
wanted to offer an array of tools that can drive or boost further weight
loss for any stubborn pounds that remain.
That was the reason all the chapters in How Not to Die on the
leading killer diseases were longer than just the three words: eat
more plants. Yes, those who go all in should end up with perfect
blood pressure and perfect cholesterol levels on average, for
example, but if you’re doing everything right and your numbers are
still off, I wanted to go through all the dietary tweaks you could use to
optimize your condition. That way, you could create a portfolio of
specific foods to help with each specific condition. I wanted to do the
same thing with How Not to Diet.
My hope is to give you an arsenal of weapons in your fight against
fat.
The average, purely plant-based person has an ideal BMI, which
greatly incentivizes sticking with that way of eating, but if that’ s not

================================================================================
PAGE 20
================================================================================
where you end up or if you just want to get there quicker, are there
specific plants that have an edge? And not some tabloid-y, fat-busting
‘breakthrough’ extrapolated from test-tube data or mouse models but
from actual randomized, controlled, clinical trials showing objective
outcomes?
Yes, there are specific foods shown in interventional studies to
cause you to burn more fat, suppress your appetite, rev up your
metabolism, block the absorption of calories and effectively take
away even more calories than they provide. What’s more, the context
in which we eat matters, too. The same number of calories eaten at a
different time of the day, in a different meal distribution or after
different amounts of sleep can translate into different amounts of
body fat. Distinct forms of the exact same foods can be distinctly
fattening. Combining certain foods together can have a different effect
from eating them apart.
What we eat matters most, but how we eat and when can also
make a difference. Even the exact same foods eaten differently can
have different effects.
Importantly, these tricks and tweaks serve to supplement a healthy,
lifelong eating pattern, not replace it. Eliminating obesity requires
treating the cause, the underlying diet, but my weight-loss boosters
are for those who want all the extra help they can get.
A HEFTIER DAILY DOZEN APP
My free Dr Greger’s Daily Dozen app released soon after publication
of How Not to Die had become so popular that I decided to
completely revamp it with new features for How Not to Diet. I
incorporated all these tweaks to the Daily Dozen to optimize it for
weight control. Now, you can not only track your progress, graphing
your momentum day to day and month to month to see how well
you’re nailing each of the Daily Dozen, but since so many seemed to
really appreciate having a list of reminders to check off throughout the
day, I added an entirely new checklist to capture the weight-loss
boosters I documented in How Not to Diet. With the new, expanded
version of the app, you can track your weight and make a game out

================================================================================

every day, along with your Daily Dozen checkboxes.

BOXES OF TRICKS
Some of the weight-loss boosters are automatically taken care of with
the Daily Dozen. For example, fat-blocking thylakoids and calcium
are covered with my recommendation to eat lots of low-oxalate
greens. But for the others, I developed my Twenty-One Tweaks,
practical takeaways from the boosters collected into one simple list.
You may have noticed that not all the strategies I covered in part 4
of How Not to Diet are included in the list. Some only apply to certain
individuals. For example, asking people to get into the NEAT habit of
using steppers, fidget bars, or bouncing their knees during prolonged
sitting may only apply to those with desk jobs. Other accelerants may
be too risky for general consumption. For example, while the 25:5
modified fasting shows promise, you probably shouldn’t drop below
1,000 calories a day for more than twenty-four hours without medical
supervision.16 Finally, there are options that show theoretical promise
but haven’t been sufficiently vetted in clinical trials, such as pistachios
for circadian synchronization or mixing peppermint oil into hand lotion
to facilitate brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation.
So, here’s the list of strategies that made the cut – broadly
applicable, relatively safe, and evidence based. See how many of
these easily actionable tweaks you can incorporate into your daily
routine.
AT EACH MEAL

================================================================================
PAGE 23
================================================================================
PRELOAD WITH WATER
Time a metabolism-boosting 2 glasses (about 500ml) of cool or cold
unflavoured water before each meal to take advantage of its preload
benefits.
PRELOAD WITH ‘NEGATIVE CALORIE’ FOODS
As the first course, start each meal with an apple or a Green Light
soup or salad containing fewer than 100 calories per cup (around
250ml or 200g, depending on ingredients). Soups and salads that fit
this criterion are marked throughout the cookbook.
INCORPORATE VINEGAR (2 TEASPOONS WITH EACH MEAL)
Never drink vinegar straight. Instead, flavour meals or dress a side
salad with any of the sweet or savoury vinegars out there. If you want
to drink it, make sure to mix it in a glass of water, and afterwards, be
sure to rinse your mouth out with water to protect your tooth enamel.
ENJOY UNDISTRACTED MEALS
Don’t eat while watching TV or playing on your phone. Give yourself a
check for each meal you’re able to eat without distraction.
FOLLOW THE TWENTY-MINUTE RULE
Whether through increasing viscosity or the number of chews or
decreasing bite size and eating rate, dozens of studies have
demonstrated that no matter how we boost the amount of time food is
in our mouths, it can result in lower caloric intake. So, extend meal
duration to at least twenty minutes to allow your natural satiety
signals to take full effect. How? By choosing foods that take longer to
eat and eating them in a way that prolongs the time they stay in your
mouth. Think bulkier, harder, chewier foods in smaller, well-chewed
bites.
EVERY DAY
TAKE YOUR DAILY DOSES
Nigella Seeds ( Nigella sativa ) (¼ teaspoon)  As noted in the
Appetite Suppression section of How Not to Diet, a systematic

================================================================================
PAGE 24
================================================================================
review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled weight-loss
trials found that about ¼ teaspoon of nigella seed powder every
day appears to reduce body mass index within a span of a couple
of months.
Garlic Powder (¼ teaspoon)  Randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies have found that as little as a daily ¼ teaspoon of
garlic powder can reduce body fat at a cost of a few pence a day .
Ground Ginger (1 teaspoon) or Cayenne (½ teaspoon)
Randomized controlled trials have found that ¼ to 1½ teaspoons a
day of ground ginger significantly decreased body weight for just
pennies a day. It can be as easy as stirring the ground spice into a
cup of hot water. Ginger may work better in the morning than
evening, and consider chai tea as a tasty way to combine the green
tea and ginger tricks into a single beverage.
Alternately, for BAT activation, you can add one raw jalapeño
pepper or ½ teaspoon of red pepper powder (or, presumably,
crushed red pepper flakes) into your daily diet. To help beat the
heat, you can very thinly slice or finely chop the jalapeño to reduce
its bite to little prickles, or mix the red pepper into soup or the whole
food vegetable smoothie featured in one of my cooking videos on
NutritionFacts.org.17
Nutritional Yeast (2 teaspoons) Two teaspoons of baker’s,
brewer’s, or nutritional yeast contain roughly the amount of beta
1,3/1,6 glucans found in randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trials to facilitate weight loss.
Cumin ( Cuminum cyminum ) (½ teaspoon with lunch and dinner)
Overweight women randomized to add ½ teaspoon of ground
cumin to each lunch and dinner beat the control group by four more
pounds and an extra inch off their waist. There is also evidence to
support the use of the spice saffron, but a pinch a day would cost a
lot, whereas a teaspoon of cumin costs very little.

================================================================================
PAGE 25
================================================================================
Green Tea (3 cups) Drink 3 cups a day between meals (waiting at
least an hour after a meal so as to not interfere with iron
absorption). During meals, drink water, black coffee or hibiscus tea
mixed 6:1 with lemon verbena, but never exceed 3 cups of fluid per
hour. This is important, given my water preloading advice.
Take advantage of the reinforcing effect of caffeine by drinking
your green tea along with something healthy you wish you liked
more, but don’t consume large amounts of caffeine within six hours
of bedtime. Taking your tea without sweetener is best, but if you
typically sweeten your tea with honey or sugar, try yacón syrup
instead.
STAY HYDRATED
Check this box if your urine never appears darker than a pale yellow .
Note that if you’re eating riboflavin-fortified foods (such as nutritional
yeast), then base this instead on getting 9 cups of unsweetened
beverages a day for women (which would be taken care of by the
green tea and water preloading recommendations) or 13 cups a day
for men. If you have heart or kidney issues, don’t increase fluid intake
at all without first talking with your doctor. Remember, diet soda may
be calorie free, but it’s not consequence free, as we learned in the
Low in Added Sugar section of How Not to Diet.
DEFLOUR YOUR DIET
Check this box every day your whole-grain servings are in the form of
intact grains. The powdering of even 100% whole grains robs our
microbiome of the starch that would otherwise be ferried down to our
colon enclosed in unbroken cell walls.
FRONT-LOAD YOUR CALORIES
There are metabolic benefits to distributing more calories to earlier in
the day, so make breakfast (ideally) or lunch your largest meal of the
day in true king/prince/pauper style.
TIME-RESTRICT YOUR EATING
Confine eating to a daily window of time of your choosing under
twelve hours in length that you can stick to consistently, seven days a

================================================================================
PAGE 26
================================================================================
week. Given the circadian benefits of reducing evening food intake,
the window should end before 7:00 p.m.
OPTIMIZE EXERCISE TIMING
The Daily Dozen’s recommendation for optimum exercise duration for
longevity is ninety minutes of moderately intense activity a day , which
is also the optimum exercise duration for weight loss. Anytime is
good, and the more the better, but there may be an advantage to
exercising in a fasted state, at least six hours after your last meal.
Typically, this would mean before breakfast, but if you timed it right,
you could exercise midday before a late lunch or, if lunch is eaten
early enough, before dinner. This is the timing for nondiabetics.
Diabetics and prediabetics should instead start exercising thirty
minutes after the start of a meal and ideally go for at least an hour to
completely straddle the blood sugar peak. If you had to choose a
single meal to exercise after, it would be dinner, due to the circadian
rhythm of blood sugar control that wanes throughout the day. Ideally,
though, breakfast would be the largest meal of the day, and you’d
exercise after that – or, even better, after every meal.
WEIGH YOURSELF TWICE A DAY
Regular self-weighing is considered crucial for long-term weight
control, but there is insufficient evidence to support a specific
frequency of weighing. My recommendation is based on the one
study that found that twice daily – upon waking and right before bed –
appeared superior to once a day (about 6 versus 2 pounds of weight
loss over 12 weeks).
COMPLETE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS
Every two months, create three new implementation intentions – ‘if X,
then Y’ plans to perform a particular behavior in a specific context –
and check each one of them off as you complete them every day.
EVERY NIGHT
FAST AFTER 7:00 P .M.

================================================================================
PAGE 27
================================================================================
Because of our circadian rhythm, food eaten at night is more fattening
than the exact same food eaten earlier in the day, so fast every night
for at least twelve hours starting before 7:00 p.m. The fewer calories
after sundown, the better.
GET SUFFICIENT SLEEP
Check this box if you get at least seven hours of sleep at your regular
bedtime.
EXPERIMENT WITH MILD TRENDELENBURG
Try spending at least four hours a night lying with your body tilted
head-down 6 degrees by elevating the posts at the foot of your bed
by 20 cm (or by 25 cm if your bed is extra long). Be extremely careful
when you get out of bed, as this may cause orthostatic intolerance,
even if you’re young and healthy – meaning if you get up too fast, you
can feel dizzy, faint or light-headed and could fall and hurt yourself.
So, get up slowly. Drinking a large glass of cold water (around 500ml)
thirty minutes before rising may also help prevent this potentially
hazardous side effect.
IMPORTANT: Do not try this at home at all if you have any heart or
lung issues, acid reflux, or problems with your brain (e.g., head
trauma) or eyes (even a family history of glaucoma disqualifies you).
Also do not try this until you ask your doctor whether he or she thinks
it’s safe for you to sleep in mild Trendelenburg.
TICK ALL THE RIGHT BOXES
Between the twenty-four checkoffs in the Daily Dozen and the thirty-
four new checkoffs in the Tweaks, you may feel a bit overwhelmed,
but it’s easy to knock off a bunch at a time. For example, starting a
meal with a tomato salad sprinkled with some nigella seeds, garlic
powder and balsamic vinegar hits five boxes right there, including the
‘Preload with “Negative Calorie” Foods’ tweak and the Daily Dozen
box for ‘Other Vegetables’. And if that was one of your
implementation intentions, make that six! Ten per cent of your boxes
nailed with a single appetizer.

================================================================================
PAGE 28
================================================================================
Of course, you don’t have to hit all the booster boxes every day .
You don’t even have to hit any. A healthy diet, as encapsulated by the
Daily Dozen, should be all you need to lose as much weight as you
want, but the more of these extra tweaks you can hit, the more
successful you may be.
The How Not to Diet Cookbook  fits as many of these combinations
together into delicious recipes and hearty meal plans, and please feel
free to download the free, updated Dr Greger’s Daily Dozen app on
your Android or iPhone. Start experimenting with a few of the Twenty-
One Tweaks and see which ones work for you. My goal is to just
provide you with the broadest palette of tools to choose from.
Remember, it’s not what you eat today that matters, or tomorrow, or
next week, but rather what you eat over the next months, years, and
decades, so you have to find lifestyle changes that fit into your
lifestyle.

SOUPS
Filling, satisfying, comforting. Soup is all of these and even more
when it comes to weight loss. If you give people a casserole for
lunch, they eat the same amount whether or not they’re also given a
glass of water, about 400 calories’ worth. But if that same casserole
and that same water are blended into a soup, they only eat 300
calories’ worth before feeling full.18 Blended together, the same meal
components served as a soup left people feeling significantly fuller
even three hours later.19
What’s so special about soup? Time. Eating more slowly may reduce
caloric intake. What’s more, soup consumers tend to have a slimmer
waist and lower body weight, and also tend to exhibit other healthy
eating behaviours, such as eating more greens and beans.20

 SPRING GREENS SOUP WITH ROASTED
ASPARAGUS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
This bright and comforting soup is packed with fresh greens,
peas and roasted asparagus. Enjoy it hot, warm or chilled.
8 ounces/225g thin asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1½-inch (4cm) pieces
(reserve the tips)
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic
6 cups/1.5 litres Light Vegetable Broth (here)
6 cups/150g coarsely chopped spinach or chard
2 cups/50g coarsely chopped rocket, watercress or mustard greens
1 cup/150g fresh or thawed frozen peas
3 spring onions, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
Ground black pepper
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon coarsely ground nigella seeds
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Line a rimmed roasting
tin with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Arrange all of the cut asparagus in the prepared roasting tin in a
single layer, but keep the tips separate from the rest of the

================================================================================
PAGE 33
================================================================================
asparagus. Roast in the oven until tender and the edges begin to
brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside, again
keeping the tips separate.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the
garlic and cook, stirring, for another minute. Add the Light Vegetable
Broth and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 7
minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the spinach, rocket,
peas and spring onions and cook until the greens are wilted and
tender from the hot broth, about 2 minutes. Stir in the roasted
asparagus (except the tips), nutritional yeast, miso paste and black
pepper to taste.
Working in batches, transfer the soup to a high-powered blender and
blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot and heat, if desired.
Stir in the lemon juice and then taste and adjust the seasonings, if
needed. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the asparagus tips
and nigella seeds.
