## Why So Few New Foods?

Pages 187-230 are primarily **RECIPE sections** (Vegetables and Beans chapters), not ingredient/database sections. These pages contain:
- Detailed recipes with cooking instructions
- Ingredients already extracted from earlier pages
- Informational boxes with scientific research
- Very few truly "new" ingredients not previously mentioned

Most ingredients mentioned (cauliflower, chickpeas, sweet potatoes, tempeh, etc.) were already extracted from pages 1-186 where they first appeared with detailed nutritional information.

The value of these pages is:
1. New grains and spices not mentioned earlier (millet, fenugreek, nutmeg, sage)
2. Scientific research boxes with health benefits
3. Cooking method recommendations
4. Usage examples and recipe applications
