## Recipes vs Individual Foods

We've been extracting INDIVIDUAL FOODS. The cookbook has ~50-60 recipes featuring these foods in combinations. We could also extract:
- **Recipe combinations** (~50 recipes)
- **Preparation methods** (soups, salads, bowls, etc.)

## Estimated Remaining Work

### Individual Foods
- **High priority**: 20-30 foods (1 extraction round, 4 agents)
- **Medium priority**: 15-20 foods (1 extraction round, 4 agents)
- **Low priority**: 10-15 foods (1 extraction round, 4 agents)

**Total: 45-65 more foods** = ~3 more extraction rounds

### If Including Recipes
- 50-60 recipe combinations
- Each recipe = combination of existing foods + preparation method
- Would create "recipe" entries with synergy details

**Total if doing recipes: ~150-180 total entries**

## Current Coverage Estimate

**Foods: 115 / ~170 = 68% complete**
- Core nutrition foods: ~85% complete
- Specialty/regional foods: ~40% complete
- Sleep/specific function foods: ~20% complete

**Overall book coverage: ~70% of unique food items**

## Recommendation

### Option 1: Complete Food Extraction (3 more rounds)
Extract remaining 45-65 foods to reach ~180 total
- Round 3: Water-rich + Legumes + Sleep foods (20-30)
- Round 4: Herbs/spices + Nuts/seeds + Vegetables (15-20)
- Round 5: Condiments + Specialty items (10-15)

**Time estimate**: 3 rounds × 15 min = 45 min

### Option 2: Stop Here + Add Recipes
Use 115 foods as base, extract recipe combinations
- Focus on synergies between foods
- Document preparation methods
- Create meal templates

**Time estimate**: ~1 hour for recipes

### Option 3: Strategic Addition (1 round)
Extract only high-impact foods (sleep, water-rich, key spices)
- Sleep foods: Critical for weight loss
- Water-rich: Core to low calorie density
- Top spices: Flavor without calories

**Time estimate**: 1 round = 15 min

## What's Most Valuable?

For your **menu planner app**, the most valuable next step is:
1. **Sleep foods** (4-6) - chronobiology impact
2. **Water-rich foods** (10-15) - satiety optimization
3. **Key spices** (8-10) - flavor variety in menus

These 25-30 foods would bring you to ~140 foods with maximum utility for menu planning.

Then move to **recipe extraction** for pre-built synergistic combinations.
