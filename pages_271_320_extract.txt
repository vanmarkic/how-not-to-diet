TEFF AND BLACK LENTILS OVER BERBERE-
SPICED KALE
MAKES: 3 to 4 servings  DIFFICULTY: Moderate
Teff is a fine grain about the size of a poppy seed. Naturally
gluten-free and high in protein, it is a staple in many East
African dishes. And berbere? It is a traditional Ethiopian spice
blend available online or in well-stocked supermarkets. You
can also make your own using the recipe on here.
LENTILS
1 cup/200g dried black lentils
1 teaspoon Berbere Spice Blend (here)
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
TEFF
1 cup/195g uncooked teff
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
GREENS
1 cup/250ml Light Vegetable Broth (here)
1 red onion, chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 tablespoons salt-free tomato puree
2 teaspoons Berbere Spice Blend (here)
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon ground coriander

================================================================================
PAGE 272
================================================================================
1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free chopped tomatoes, undrained
8 cups/250g chopped kale or other dark leafy greens, tough stems removed
FOR THE LENTILS:  In a small saucepan, combine the lentils, Berbere
Spice Blend, onion powder and garlic powder. Add 2¼ cups/560ml of
water and bring to a simmer. Cover and continue to simmer over a
low heat until the lentils are tender but not mushy, about 20 minutes.
FOR THE TEFF: While the lentils are cooking, combine the teff,
nutritional yeast and miso paste in another small saucepan. Stir in 1¼
cups/310ml of water and bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to low,
cover and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the teff is tender and the
water is absorbed. Fluff it with a fork, cover and set aside until ready
to serve.
FOR THE GREENS:  Heat ¼ cup/60ml of the Light Vegetable Broth in a
large skillet or heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Add the
onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
tomato puree, Berbere Spice Blend, paprika, coriander and tomatoes
with their juices and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer;
then add the kale and the remaining broth. Cook, stirring frequently ,
until the kale is tender and the flavours are combined, about 10
minutes.
TO SERVE:  Divide the greens among three to four shallow bowls, top
with the teff, followed by the lentils. Serve hot.
ARE ANCIENT GRAINS HEALTHIER?
Are ancient grains healthier than modern ones? Based
on vitamin and mineral concentrations, it’s pretty
similar,81 though primitive wheats have more antioxidant
capacity.82 Ancient wheat products do appear to
be anti-inflammatory and may improve blood sugar
control and cholesterol. The best available data suggest

================================================================================

================================================================================
they’re better, so if you have the choice, why not opt for
ancient varieties?

GRAIN-STUFFED PEPPERS WITH CHEESY
TOMATO SAUCE
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
This recipe calls for my beloved Basic BROL, the powerfully
healthy and delicious combination of barley, rye, oats, and
lentils, but any cooked whole grains may be used for the
stuffing.
PEPPERS
4 large red peppers
1 red onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, chopped
2 cups/360g Basic BROL (here), cooled, or other cooked* whole grains of your
choice
1½ cups/250g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free
chickpeas, drained and rinsed
2 tablespoons ground flaxseeds
1 teaspoon white miso paste
¼ cup/35g nutritional yeast
4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
1½ cups/390g tomato puree
CHEESY TOMATO SAUCE
1 cup/175g cooked* or BPA-free tinned or Tetra Pak salt-free white beans,
drained and rinsed
⅓ cup/45g nutritional yeast

================================================================================
PAGE 276
================================================================================
1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons white miso paste
½ teaspoon salt-free yellow mustard
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 (¼-inch/5mm) piece fresh turmeric, grated, or ¼ teaspoon ground
½ cup/130g tomato puree
FOR THE PEPPERS: Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5.
Cut off the top ½ inch/1cm of the peppers and set the tops aside.
Remove the seeds from the pepper cavities and set the peppers
aside. Chop the reserved pepper tops after discarding the stems.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large skillet or heavy-based frying pan
over a medium-high heat. Add the chopped pepper tops, onion, and
garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened,
about 7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.
In a large bowl, combine the cooked and cooled Basic BROL,
chickpeas, ground flaxseeds, miso paste, nutritional yeast, parsley ,
smoked paprika and black pepper. Stir in the cooked vegetables and
½ cup/130g of the tomato puree and mix well.
Fill the pepper cavities with the stuffing mixture. Arrange the stuffed
peppers standing upright and next to one another in a baking dish.
Pour the remaining tomato puree and ¼ cup/60ml of water around
the peppers. Cover tightly and place in the oven. Bake for about 45
minutes, or until the peppers are soft and the stuffing is hot.
FOR THE CHEESY TOMATO SAUCE: While the peppers bake, make the
sauce. Combine all the sauce ingredients, except the tomato puree,
in a high-powered blender. Process until smooth, scraping down the
sides as needed. Add the tomato puree and blend again. If the sauce
is too thick, add a little water, 2 tablespoons at a time, until the sauce

================================================================================
PAGE 277
================================================================================
is smooth. Transfer the sauce to a saucepan and warm gently over a
medium-low heat, stirring, to heat through. Taste and adjust the
seasonings, if needed. Keep warm.
TO SERVE:  When ready to serve, place each stuffed pepper upright on
a serving plate or shallow serving bowl and top with the Cheesy
Tomato Sauce.

GREEN TEA QUINOA AND PEAS WITH ROASTED
ASPARAGUS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Inspired by the Japanese dish known as ochazuke  (white rice
steeped in green tea), this version uses quinoa instead of rice
and pairs with roasted asparagus. Top with toasted nori and
sesame seeds for even more texture and flavour.
3 green tea bags
3 cups/750ml hot water
1 pound/450g asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces
1 cup/170g uncooked quinoa, well rinsed and drained
1 garlic clove, finely chopped
1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
1 cup/150g frozen peas
½ cup/75g finely chopped spring onions
2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds
Ground black pepper
1 lemon, cut into wedges
Place the tea bags in a bowl with the hot water. Steep the tea for 8 to
10 minutes, then remove and discard the tea bags. Set the brewed
tea aside.
Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line a large, rimmed
baking tray with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Spread the asparagus pieces on the prepared baking tray. Roast in
the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned on

================================================================================
PAGE 280
================================================================================
the edges. Set aside.
Combine the quinoa, garlic, ginger and steeped tea in a medium
saucepan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, cover,
and simmer for 10 minutes. Add the peas, cover, and cook for
another 5 minutes, or until the tea is absorbed and the quinoa and
peas are cooked. Remove from the heat and stir in the spring onions
and asparagus.
To serve, spoon the quinoa into serving bowls and top with sesame
seeds and black pepper. Serve with lemon wedges.
QUINOA AND TRIGLYCERIDES
Quinoa is a seed-like fruit high in protein,83 vitamins,
magnesium, iron, and zinc.84 About a cup a day of
cooked quinoa for twelve weeks led to a 36 per cent
drop in triglycerides, comparable to what one gets with
triglycerides-lowering drugs or high-dose fish oil
supplements.85

================================================================================
PAGE 282
================================================================================
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
Barley and cabbage go together like peanut butter and jam.
These stuffed cabbage rolls are sure to become a favourite!
TOMATO SAUCE
½ cup/75g chopped onion
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 teaspoons white miso paste
2 (400g) BPA-free tins or Tetra Paks salt-free finely chopped tomatoes
¼ cup/35g nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
¼ cup/4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Ground black pepper
FILLING
2 cups/370g cooked* barley
3 cups/525g cooked* or 2 (400g) BPA-free tins or Tetra Paks salt-free white
beans, drained and rinsed
1 small red onion, finely chopped
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped

¼ cup/4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
Ground black pepper
CABBAGE
1 large head red cabbage

================================================================================
PAGE 283
================================================================================
FOR THE TOMATO SAUCE:  Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large saucepan
over a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook, stirring
occasionally, until the onion is tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the
miso paste, tomatoes, nutritional yeast, oregano, basil, parsley and
black pepper to taste. Lower the heat to low, cover, and cook until the
flavours are well blended, about 20 minutes. Taste and adjust the
seasonings, if needed. Set aside.
FOR THE FILLING:  In a bowl, combine all the filling ingredients and mix
well. Set aside.
Preheat the oven to 190°C/375°F/gas mark 5.
FOR THE CABBAGE:  Trim the cabbage of any damaged leaves and use a
sharp knife to cut out the core. Place the cabbage, cut side down, in a
large pot along with enough water to cover, and then bring to the boil.
Cook until the leaves soften and begin to unfold, about 10 minutes.
Use tongs to remove the leaves as soon as they soften and carefully
place them on a plate to cool. Continue until you have at least 12
cooked leaves.
One at a time, arrange the leaves on a cutting board with the stem
end nearest you. Place about ¼ cup/4 of filling at the stem end. Fold
the stem end and sides over the filling and roll the cabbage leaf up
tightly. Continue until all the cabbage rolls have been made.
TO ASSEMBLE AND SERVE:  Spread half of the sauce onto the bottom of a
large, shallow baking dish. Arrange the cabbage rolls, seam side
down, on top of the sauce. Spoon all but 1 cup of sauce over the
cabbage rolls, and then cover the rolls with 3 to 4 leftover leaves.
Spoon the remaining sauce over the leaves. Cover the baking dish
tightly and bake for 45 minutes, or until the rolls are tender. Serve hot.

BREAKFAST
Is breakfast the most important meal of the day? Well, according to
chronobiology, the study of how our body’s natural cycles – mental,
physical and emotional – are affected by the rhythms of the sun,
moon and seasons, it seems that it is when it comes to losing
weight.
Calories eaten in the morning seem to be less fattening than calories
eaten in the evening. More calories are burned off in the morning
due to diet-induced thermogenesis, the amount of energy the body
takes to digest and process a meal, given off in part as waste heat.
When people consume the exact same meal in the morning,
afternoon, and at night, their body uses up about 25 per cent more
calories to process the meal in the afternoon than at night and about

================================================================================
PAGE 286
================================================================================
50 per cent more calories to digest it in the morning.86 That leaves
fewer net calories in the morning to be stored as fat.
These bright, bountiful breakfast recipes will help you heed the
proverb ‘Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like
a pauper’ and take advantage of the metabolic benefits to distributing
more calories to earlier in the day.

CEREAL OR OATMEAL?
After eating Honey Nut Cheerios, study participants felt
significantly hungrier than after the same calories of
oatmeal. Food structure, not just nutrient composition,
may be critical for optimal health.87 Rolled oats, for
instance, have a lower glycemic index than instant
oatmeal,88 and oat flakes cause lower blood sugar and
insulin spikes than powdered oats.89 Different forms of
the same ingredient can have different effects.

ARE MICROWAVE OVENS SAFE?
A famous radio telescope scan-ning the cosmos for
extraterrestrial civilizations detected ‘fast radio bursts’.
Signs of extragalactic intelligence? No. It turns out ET
was a microwave in the staff cafeteria that the telescope
picked up when someone opened the door.90 Indeed,
there is some leakage of microwaves during operation,91
but it appears microwaves should be safe – though it
can’t hurt to stand back when they’re in operation.

SLOW COOKER APPLE PIE OAT GROATS

================================================================================
PAGE 309
================================================================================
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Waking up to the sweet, rich aroma of this apple pie-inspired
groatmeal is a great inducement to getting out of bed in the
morning. This dish needs about eight hours for the oat groats
to soak and another eight hours for the groatmeal to cook in a
slow cooker, so plan ahead. The effort is minimal, and the
time is very well worth it.
1 cup/180g oat groats, soaked for about 8 hours in water and then drained
2 tablespoons ground chia seeds
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1 apple, cored and grated with its peel
Optional toppings: goji berries, Date Syrup (here), ground cinnamon, dried or
fresh fruit, or sliced or chopped nuts
In a 3.8 litre (or larger) slow cooker, combine the drained soaked oat
groats with the chia seeds and cinnamon, stirring to mix well. Add the
grated apple and 2¾ cups/675ml of water and stir to combine. Put the
lid on the slow cooker and cook on low for about 8 hours. Stir the
cooked groatmeal before spooning into serving bowls. Sprinkle with
your desired toppings and serve.
DON’T PEEL YOUR APPLES
Eating just one apple a day is associated with a 35 per
cent lower risk of dying from all causes.92 Flavonoids,
phytonutrients concentrated in the skins of apples, may
play a role by improving artery function,93 so don’t peel
your apples!

FRUIT
When study participants were randomized to a diet low in all sugars,
even the naturally occurring sugars in fruit, they did worse than those
randomized to cut down just added sugars. Those who retained fruit
in their diet lost nearly 50 per cent more weight.94
Fruit can actually facilitate weight loss. What’s more, increasing
consumption of fruits and vegetables may reduce the risk of three of
our leading causes of death – heart disease, stroke and high blood
pressure – and may help protect us from cancer, our other top
killer.95 So, pick up an apple, peel a banana, bite into a juicy peach,
throw back a handful of blueberries, and get creative with these
flavoursome fruity recipes.

Make this quick and easy treat at the peak of berry season. I
like to combine several different berries, but it’s also delicious
with just one or two types, if you prefer. This recipe serves
four, but if you’re making it for just one or two people, cut
back on the amount of berries and/or only add the mint leaves
and balsamic when ready to serve.
⅓ cup/75ml chocolate balsamic vinegar or Balsamic Syrup (here)
1½ cups/225g strawberries, hulled and halved
¾ cup/95g raspberries
1 cup/100g blueberries
½ cup/75g blackberries
2 tablespoons fresh mint leaves
1 tablespoon cacao nibs
¼ cup/30g coarsely chopped pecans or walnuts (optional)
If not using Balsamic Syrup, pour the chocolate balsamic vinegar into
a small saucepan and simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes, or
until reduced by about one-third. Remove from the heat and set the
vinegar aside to cool to room temperature before using.
In a large serving bowl, combine all the berries with the mint leaves.
Spoon into individual glass serving bowls and drizzle on the
chocolate balsamic reduction or Balsamic Syrup. Top with the cacao
nibs and nuts (if using).

BENEFITS OF BLUEBERRIES ON HEART
DISEASE AND CHOLESTEROL
Four out of five studies suggest that increased intake of
berries, with their brightly coloured pigments called
anthocyanins, is significantly associated with a reduction
in risk of coronary heart disease, our number one killer,
by 12 to 32 per cent.96
What do berries have to do with
the heart?
Berries help control bad LDL cholesterol, blood pressure,
blood sugars, body weight, diabetes, and inflammation.97

MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
A drupe, more commonly known as stone fruit, is so named
because it contains a stone (or pit) inside. Many popular
stone fruits, such as cherries, plums, peaches, nectarines,
mangoes and dates, are in season in late summer.
3 tablespoons ground chia seeds
1½ cups/260g fresh or thawed frozen diced mango
1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
2 pitted soft dates, soaked for 10 minutes in hot water and then drained
3 ripe apricots, pitted and quartered
3 ripe plums, pitted and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces
2 ripe peaches or nectarines, pitted and cut into 1-inch/2.5cm pieces
2 cups/450g pitted cherries
In a small bowl, combine the chia seeds and ¼ cup/60ml of water and
mix well. Set aside for 10 minutes to thicken.
In a food processor or blender, combine the mango, lemon juice,
dates and the chia mixture and process until smooth. Divide equally
among four small glass dessert bowls. Cover and refrigerate until
firm, 4 hours or overnight.
Combine the apricots, plums, peaches, and cherries in a large bowl.
Toss gently to combine.
To serve, spoon the fruit evenly over the chilled mango mixture.
Serve immediately.

================================================================================
MAKES: 2 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
This refreshing chia pudding can be made with different fruits
whether to take advantage of the fruits in season or to suit
your own taste.
1 cup/125g fresh or thawed frozen raspberries
1 cup/175g fresh or thawed frozen diced mango
4 tablespoons ground chia seeds
Optional garnishes: diced mango, fresh raspberries, sunflower seeds or
pumpkin seeds
In a high-powered blender, combine the raspberries, mango, and ½
cup/120ml of water and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into two
dessert bowls or glass jars. Add 2 tablespoons of the ground chia
seeds to each bowl and stir until evenly distributed. Cover and
refrigerate for 8 hours or overnight. Serve as is or topped with garnish
of choice.
IS MELAMINE SAFE?
Melamine, used to make inexpensive, hard plastic
kitchenware, isn’t suitable for microwaves and cooking,98
but what about for just eating or drinking? Exposure to
the
chemical compound is significantly associated with
kidney function deterioration in patients with early-stage
chronic kidney disease,99 so I’d skip melamine
altogether.

No need to feel deprived of a special dessert around the
holidays with this pumpkin pie that is free of crust, sugar and
dairy, but filled with the great taste of pumpkin and spices.
3 tablespoons ground chia seeds
1 cup/150g raw unsalted cashews, soaked in hot water for 30 minutes and then
drained
1 (400g) BPA-free tin solid-pack pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)
⅓ cup/115g treacle, at room temperature
⅓ cup/75ml Date Syrup (here), at room temperature
1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice or mixed spice
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
TO SERVE
⅓ cup/40g chopped walnuts (optional)
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/gas mark 4.
In a small bowl, combine the ground chia seeds and 3 tablespoons of
water, stirring to mix well. Set aside for 10 minutes to thicken.
Combine the drained cashews and the chia mixture in a high-
powered blender and blend until the nuts are finely ground. Add the
pumpkin puree, treacle, Date Syrup, pumpkin pie or mixed spice and
vanilla and blend until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes, stopping
to scrape down the sides as needed.
Transfer the mixture into a 9-inch/23cm pie plate and bake for 45
minutes, or until the top looks cooked. Let the pie cool completely to
room temperature, 1 to 2 hours, and then refrigerate until chilled and
firm, about 3 hours. Keep refrigerated for up to 3 days.
