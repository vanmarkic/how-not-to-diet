Diets don’t work by definition. Going on a diet implies that, at some
point, you will go off the diet. Short-term fixes are no match for long-
term problems. Lifelong weight control requires lifelong lifestyle
changes.
First, a diet has to be sustainable. Consider water-only fasting. No
diet works better. It’s 100 per cent effective, but also 100 per cent
fatal if you manage to stick with it. This is why an optimal diet needs
additional building blocks to ensure long-term viability.
Along with being efficacious and sustainable, it needs to be safe.
Books touting liquid protein diets in the 1970s sold millions of copies,
but the diets started killing people. Safety is about losing weight
without losing your health.
Any long-term eating pattern must also be nutritionally complete,
containing all essential vitamins and minerals, and finally, our chosen
diet should be life-extending. In the very least, what we eat shouldn’t
cut our life short and ideally should be healthy enough to improve our
life spans. There’s no point in losing weight if it causes you to lose it
all.
After diving deep into the medical literature, I identified seventeen
key ingredients to the ideal weight-loss diet and dedicated a chapter
in my book How Not to Diet to each. The foods we eat and, in fact,
our meals and entire dietary patterns should be anti-inflammatory;
free from industrial pollutants; high in fibre and water; and low in high-
glycemic and addictive foods, added fat and sugar, calorie density,
meat, refined grains, and salt. They should also be low insulin index,
friendly to our friendly gut flora, particularly satiating, and rich in fruits
and vegetables as well as legumes.
We should eat real food that grows out of the ground; natural foods
that come from fields, not factories; from gardens, not garbage; a diet
centred on whole plant foods.
It turns out the healthiest diet also appears to be the most effective
diet for weight loss. Indeed, we have experimental confirmation: a
whole food, plant-based diet was found to be the single most effective
weight-loss intervention ever published in the medical literature,
proven in a randomized controlled trial with no portion control, no
calorie counting, no exercise component – the most effective ever .5

================================================================================
PAGE 9
================================================================================
I didn’t stop there, though. I spent the second half of How Not to
Diet on all the tools I had unearthed in my research to drive further
weight loss for any stubborn pounds that remain.
In the first half of the book, we learned that a calorie is not
necessarily a calorie. One hundred calories of chickpeas have a
different impact than one hundred calories of chicken or chocolate,
based on their different effects on such factors as absorption, appetite
or our microbiome. In the second half, I went a step further and
explained how even the exact same foods eaten differently can have
different effects. It’s not only what we eat, but how and when .
The one piece of advice that probably best sums up my
recommended weight-loss boosters would be to wall off your calories .
Animal cells are encased only in easily digestible membranes, which
allow the enzymes in our gut to effortlessly liberate the calories within
a steak, for example. Plant cells, on the other hand, have cell walls
that are made out of fibre which acts as an indigestible physical
barrier, so many of the calories remain trapped. Processed plant
foods, however, such as fruit juice, sugar, refined grains, and even
whole grains if they’ve been powdered into flour, have had their
cellular structure destroyed and their cell walls cracked open, so their
calories are free for the taking. When you eat structurally intact plant
foods, though, you can chew all you want, but you’ll still end up with
calories completely encapsulated by fibre, which then blunts the
glycemic impact, activates what’s called the ileal brake that dials
down appetite, and delivers sustenance to your friendly flora.
So, try to make sure as many of your calories – whether from
protein, carbs or fat – are encased in cell walls. In other words, get as
many of your calories from whole, intact plant foods.
I went into this project with the goal of creating a distillation of all
the best science, but, to my delight, I discovered all sorts of exciting
new tools and tricks along the way, a treasure trove of buried data,
such as simple spices proven in randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies to accelerate weight loss for pennies a day. With so
little profit potential, it’s no wonder those studies never saw the light
of day. And I was even able to traverse beyond the existing evidence

================================================================================
PAGE 12
================================================================================
attributes that could be used to create the most effective eating plan
for losing weight.
On the next page are the seventeen ingredients for an optimum
weight-loss diet laid out in worksheet form.
In that first blank column, you can place a dietary pattern, a meal or
even an individual food. Try pencilling in some of the diets you’ve
heard about. How do they rate? How many boxes can you tick off? A
paleo diet, for example, might nail the fruit-and-vegetables box but fail
the legumes one.
The next time you sit down for supper, look at your meal and see
how many checkmarks it earns. You can imagine how a typical fast-
food meal might get a big goose egg – zero out of seventeen –
whereas a healthy Mediterranean meal might hit eleven or more due
to its vegetable-centric nature. A traditional Mediterranean bean-and-
vegetable stew would be anti-inflammatory, low on the food chain,
and high in fibre, trapped water and veggies; have a low glycemic
load and insulin index; be free of habit-forming ultraprocessed foods;
and could be low in added fat, sugar, meat, salt and refined grains.
The beans check off legumes and microbiome-building, and soups
are particularly satiating and low in calorie density. So, that one stew
could potentially check off all seventeen optimal weight-loss
ingredients. If you had it with bread dipped in oil, though, the meal as
a whole might fail to meet the glycemic and insulin response criteria
as well as the added fat, refined grains and sodium conditions, but it
would still be better than most meals people eat.

================================================================================
PAGE 13
================================================================================
Every meal is a new opportunity to tick as many checkmarks as
you can. Imagine looking over a Chinese takeout menu. Some items,

================================================================================
PAGE 14
================================================================================
like General Tso’s chicken – deep-fried meat served in a sugary
sauce atop white rice – may not include any of the optimum weight-
loss ingredients, whereas a dish from the vegetable section, such as
broccoli with garlic sauce, might incorporate at least half of them. At a
quick-service Mexican restaurant, a bean burrito bowl salad could let
you tick off most of them, especially if you hold the white rice, but
nothing beats the control you have at home to prepare a healthy dish
without added salt, sugar, and fat.
To reverse-engineer the optimal weight-loss diet, we can figure out
what constitutes the ideal meal by ranking individual foods – and the
more boxes they check, the better. Most fruits and vegetables would
top the list at sixteen out of seventeen. By my count, legumes, whole
grains, and nuts and seeds together would hit fifteen, fourteen and
thirteen, respectively, but refined grains and animal products would
slip down into single digits. Ultraprocessed fatty and sugary snacks
might only score one or two, and a product that’s both, such as
sweet-flavoured jerky, might completely flop.
Note that some of these criteria are much more important than
others. For example, while the value of eating anti-inflammatory foods
remains theoretical, there are multiple randomized controlled trials
validating the benefits of reducing calorie density. Read through How
Not to Diet  and decide which are most convincing to you and may be
easiest to fit into your daily routine.
To varying degrees, any one of these criteria alone may facilitate
weight loss. Even just cutting out added sugars without making any
other changes at all, for example, could cause you to lose weight.
Now imagine if you tried putting them all together.
THE DAILY DOZEN DIET
In How Not to Die, I compiled the healthiest of the Green Light foods
– foods of plant origin from which nothing bad has been added and
nothing good has been taken away – into my Daily Dozen checklist of
foods I encourage people to try to fit into their daily routines. I made it

================================================================================
PAGE 15
================================================================================
into a free app, Dr Greger’s Daily Dozen, available for iPhone and
Android, so anyone and everyone can try to check off all the boxes
every day and track their progress over time.
TOO MUCH FOOD, NOT ENOUGH CALORIES
As the feedback poured in from people using the app, two themes of
complaints arose. The first was that it was just too much food. There
was no way they could eat all that food in one day. In response, I
explained that the Daily Dozen was aspirational, something to shoot
for, just a tool to inspire people to include some of the healthiest of
healthy foods into their daily diet. The vast volume of food I
prescribed was on purpose. I was hoping that by telling people to eat
so much healthy stuff, it would naturally crowd out some of the less
healthy stuff. After checking off all twenty-four servings in the Daily
Dozen, there’s only so much room left for a pepperoni pizza.

Here is the Daily Dozen and the number of servings
I recommend for each one. For years, I had this list
on a little dry-erase board on our refrigerator. Feel
free to cut this one out (or make your own copy) and
do the same. It’s also useful to take with you when
you go shopping to guide you through your
healthiest choices. And remember, it’s just about
doing your best. There are times, especially when I
am travelling, that I only hit a quarter of my goals.
When that happens, I just try to make up for it the
next day. The same goes for you: If one day you
only get a few of these foods into your diet, the next
day, do your best to get more!
Ironically, the second major complaint we got is that it doesn’t have
enough calories. I had to explain that the Daily Dozen just
represented the minimum I encourage people to eat, not the
maximum, and that, certainly, training athletes requiring thousands
more calories would have to eat much more. This all got me thinking,
though. Too much food but too few calories?  Sounds like the perfect
weight-loss diet!
The Daily Dozen is by definition all Green Light foods, all whole
plant foods, so that right there bakes in all seventeen of the ideal
weight-loss diet ingredients listed on here. What about the calorie
count? A systematic review of successful weight-loss strategies
concluded that given the metabolic slowing and increased appetite
that accompanies weight loss, to achieve significant weight loss,
calorie counts may need to drop as low as 1,200 calories a day for

================================================================================
PAGE 17
================================================================================
women and 1,500 calories a day for men.9 I set up a spreadsheet and
tried a bunch of common foods in each of the categories, and what
do you know: the Daily Dozen averages about 1,200 calories, with
the higher-calorie food choices nailing 1,500 calories.
GREEN LIGHT FOR WEIGHT LOSS
How is my Green Light category in How Not to Die different from my
recommendation in How Not to Diet to wall off your calories, to
ensure your protein, carbs, and fat are trapped within cell walls? After
all, only plants have cell walls. (Animals are made up of cells with
fluid membranes, requiring bones to hold them up, whereas plants
have rigid cell walls made out of fibre.) So, isn’t walling off calories
the same as choosing whole plant foods? The difference becomes
apparent with examples of formless foods, such as powdered whole
grains. Imagine a whole-grain wheat cereal with one ingredient: 100%
whole wheat. Or almond butter with one ingredient: almonds. Green
Light, right? Plant foods from which nothing bad has been added and
nothing good has been taken away. But now we know something
good has been taken away: the structure.
Eating whole grains is good, but eating whole-grain kernels is
better. Former Harvard nutrition chair Walter Willett has argued that
the term whole grain  should probably be reserved for only whole,
intact grain kernels.10 So, eat the wholiest of grains: intact grains,
also known as groats.
Take oats, for example. They’re found out in the fields as oat groats
and then have their inedible outer husks removed during
processing.11 Groats can then be sliced into two to four pieces to
make steel-cut (also known as pinhead or Irish) oats, coarsely ground
into Scottish oatmeal, or steamed and flattened into ‘old-fashioned’
rolled oats.12 Quick-cooking oats are just old-fashioned oats rolled
even thinner, and instant oats are steamed longer and rolled even
more thinly.13 Then, at the bottom of the list, the most processed
would be powdered oats, which you might find in oat-based breakfast

================================================================================
PAGE 18
================================================================================
cereals. Instead of buying boxed breakfast cereals, make oatmeal out
of whole, intact oats. They’re gr-r-oat!
With all the new data on the importance of food form, I’m starting to
sour on flour, so I advise not living by bread alone. The new structure
created by the pasta-making process can mediate these effects,
though, so you don’t have to say basta to pasta.
OPTIMIZING THE DAILY DOZEN FOR WEIGHT LOSS
A typical Green Light foods breakfast that would check off a few of
the Daily Dozen boxes would be a big bowl of oatmeal sweetened
with raisins. On the basis of what we learned in the Low in Calorie
Density, High in Water-Rich Foods, Eating Rate, and Wall Off Your
Calories sections of How Not to Diet, though, we could optimize that
meal for weight loss by making the oatmeal from steel-cut or whole
groats rather than rolled or instant, cooking it thick, and switching the
dried fruit for fresh – for example, swapping in strawberries for the
raisins. If we did want to use dried, as we learned in the Amping
AMPK and Inflammation Quenchers sections, barberries or gojis
might be a better choice.
Similarly, when choosing vegetables, we can steer toward
aboveground veggies highest on the water scale. Peppers have that
nicotine edge I described in Amping AMPK, and uncooked
vegetables in general offer more orosensory stimulation. If you want
to go underground, on the basis of what we learned about glycemic
load, sweet potatoes would be preferable to white. We certainly want
to mix it up, though, to take advantage of our built-in striving for
variety, and since vegetables represent the healthiest class of foods
with the fewest calories, we should aim to eat them earlier in the
meal.
In the Appetite Suppression section, we learned yet another reason
to include ground flaxseeds in our daily diet. Nuts are a great
complement to greens to boost the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients,
but, ideally, they should be eaten raw and whole or coarsely chopped
rather than blended into butters. This is not to say something like

================================================================================
PAGE 19
================================================================================
almond butter or tahini is unhealthy by any stretch, but for weight-loss
acceleration, structurally intact nuts and seeds would be better .
TWENTY-ONE TWEAKS TO
ACCELERATE WEIGHT LOSS
Offering maximum nutrition with minimum calories, a diet centered on
whole, healthy plant foods is the best form of girth control. Whole
food, plant-based nutrition best checks off the criteria for the optimal
slimming diet. It’s the tried-and-true recipe with the most ideal weight-
loss diet ingredients – so why wasn’t that the end of How Not to Diet?
Just eating healthfully enough should do it. Obese individuals
randomized to eat plant-based at home lose nearly a cubic inch of
deep visceral belly fat a week.14 Start packing your diet with real food
that grows out of the ground, and the pounds should come off
naturally, taking you down toward your ideal weight. The average
person eating completely plant-based has a body mass index (BMI)
down around the perfect range,15 but there is a bell curve. Even if the
average is on target, some people naturally fall to either side, so I
wanted to offer an array of tools that can drive or boost further weight
loss for any stubborn pounds that remain.
That was the reason all the chapters in How Not to Die on the
leading killer diseases were longer than just the three words: eat
more plants. Yes, those who go all in should end up with perfect
blood pressure and perfect cholesterol levels on average, for
example, but if you’re doing everything right and your numbers are
still off, I wanted to go through all the dietary tweaks you could use to
optimize your condition. That way, you could create a portfolio of
specific foods to help with each specific condition. I wanted to do the
same thing with How Not to Diet.
My hope is to give you an arsenal of weapons in your fight against
fat.
The average, purely plant-based person has an ideal BMI, which
greatly incentivizes sticking with that way of eating, but if that’ s not

================================================================================
PAGE 20
================================================================================
where you end up or if you just want to get there quicker, are there
specific plants that have an edge? And not some tabloid-y, fat-busting
‘breakthrough’ extrapolated from test-tube data or mouse models but
from actual randomized, controlled, clinical trials showing objective
outcomes?
Yes, there are specific foods shown in interventional studies to
cause you to burn more fat, suppress your appetite, rev up your
metabolism, block the absorption of calories and effectively take
away even more calories than they provide. What’s more, the context
in which we eat matters, too. The same number of calories eaten at a
different time of the day, in a different meal distribution or after
different amounts of sleep can translate into different amounts of
body fat. Distinct forms of the exact same foods can be distinctly
fattening. Combining certain foods together can have a different effect
from eating them apart.
What we eat matters most, but how we eat and when can also
make a difference. Even the exact same foods eaten differently can
have different effects.
Importantly, these tricks and tweaks serve to supplement a healthy,
lifelong eating pattern, not replace it. Eliminating obesity requires
treating the cause, the underlying diet, but my weight-loss boosters
are for those who want all the extra help they can get.
A HEFTIER DAILY DOZEN APP
My free Dr Greger’s Daily Dozen app released soon after publication
of How Not to Die had become so popular that I decided to
completely revamp it with new features for How Not to Diet. I
incorporated all these tweaks to the Daily Dozen to optimize it for
weight control. Now, you can not only track your progress, graphing
your momentum day to day and month to month to see how well
you’re nailing each of the Daily Dozen, but since so many seemed to
really appreciate having a list of reminders to check off throughout the
day, I added an entirely new checklist to capture the weight-loss
boosters I documented in How Not to Diet. With the new, expanded
version of the app, you can track your weight and make a game out

BOXES OF TRICKS
Some of the weight-loss boosters are automatically taken care of with
the Daily Dozen. For example, fat-blocking thylakoids and calcium
are covered with my recommendation to eat lots of low-oxalate
greens. But for the others, I developed my Twenty-One Tweaks,
practical takeaways from the boosters collected into one simple list.
You may have noticed that not all the strategies I covered in part 4
of How Not to Diet are included in the list. Some only apply to certain
individuals. For example, asking people to get into the NEAT habit of
using steppers, fidget bars, or bouncing their knees during prolonged
sitting may only apply to those with desk jobs. Other accelerants may
be too risky for general consumption. For example, while the 25:5
modified fasting shows promise, you probably shouldn’t drop below
1,000 calories a day for more than twenty-four hours without medical
supervision.16 Finally, there are options that show theoretical promise
but haven’t been sufficiently vetted in clinical trials, such as pistachios
for circadian synchronization or mixing peppermint oil into hand lotion
to facilitate brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation.
So, here’s the list of strategies that made the cut – broadly
applicable, relatively safe, and evidence based. See how many of
these easily actionable tweaks you can incorporate into your daily
routine.
AT EACH MEAL

================================================================================
PAGE 23
================================================================================
PRELOAD WITH WATER
Time a metabolism-boosting 2 glasses (about 500ml) of cool or cold
unflavoured water before each meal to take advantage of its preload
benefits.
PRELOAD WITH ‘NEGATIVE CALORIE’ FOODS
As the first course, start each meal with an apple or a Green Light
soup or salad containing fewer than 100 calories per cup (around
250ml or 200g, depending on ingredients). Soups and salads that fit
this criterion are marked throughout the cookbook.
INCORPORATE VINEGAR (2 TEASPOONS WITH EACH MEAL)
Never drink vinegar straight. Instead, flavour meals or dress a side
salad with any of the sweet or savoury vinegars out there. If you want
to drink it, make sure to mix it in a glass of water, and afterwards, be
sure to rinse your mouth out with water to protect your tooth enamel.
ENJOY UNDISTRACTED MEALS
Don’t eat while watching TV or playing on your phone. Give yourself a
check for each meal you’re able to eat without distraction.
FOLLOW THE TWENTY-MINUTE RULE
Whether through increasing viscosity or the number of chews or
decreasing bite size and eating rate, dozens of studies have
demonstrated that no matter how we boost the amount of time food is
in our mouths, it can result in lower caloric intake. So, extend meal
duration to at least twenty minutes to allow your natural satiety
signals to take full effect. How? By choosing foods that take longer to
eat and eating them in a way that prolongs the time they stay in your
mouth. Think bulkier, harder, chewier foods in smaller, well-chewed
bites.
EVERY DAY
TAKE YOUR DAILY DOSES
Nigella Seeds ( Nigella sativa ) (¼ teaspoon)  As noted in the
Appetite Suppression section of How Not to Diet, a systematic

================================================================================
PAGE 24
================================================================================
review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled weight-loss
trials found that about ¼ teaspoon of nigella seed powder every
day appears to reduce body mass index within a span of a couple
of months.
Garlic Powder (¼ teaspoon)  Randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled studies have found that as little as a daily ¼ teaspoon of
garlic powder can reduce body fat at a cost of a few pence a day .
Ground Ginger (1 teaspoon) or Cayenne (½ teaspoon)
Randomized controlled trials have found that ¼ to 1½ teaspoons a
day of ground ginger significantly decreased body weight for just
pennies a day. It can be as easy as stirring the ground spice into a
cup of hot water. Ginger may work better in the morning than
evening, and consider chai tea as a tasty way to combine the green
tea and ginger tricks into a single beverage.
Alternately, for BAT activation, you can add one raw jalapeño
pepper or ½ teaspoon of red pepper powder (or, presumably,
crushed red pepper flakes) into your daily diet. To help beat the
heat, you can very thinly slice or finely chop the jalapeño to reduce
its bite to little prickles, or mix the red pepper into soup or the whole
food vegetable smoothie featured in one of my cooking videos on
NutritionFacts.org.17
Nutritional Yeast (2 teaspoons) Two teaspoons of baker’s,
brewer’s, or nutritional yeast contain roughly the amount of beta
1,3/1,6 glucans found in randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trials to facilitate weight loss.
Cumin ( Cuminum cyminum ) (½ teaspoon with lunch and dinner)
Overweight women randomized to add ½ teaspoon of ground
cumin to each lunch and dinner beat the control group by four more
pounds and an extra inch off their waist. There is also evidence to
support the use of the spice saffron, but a pinch a day would cost a
lot, whereas a teaspoon of cumin costs very little.

================================================================================
PAGE 25
================================================================================
Green Tea (3 cups) Drink 3 cups a day between meals (waiting at
least an hour after a meal so as to not interfere with iron
absorption). During meals, drink water, black coffee or hibiscus tea
mixed 6:1 with lemon verbena, but never exceed 3 cups of fluid per
hour. This is important, given my water preloading advice.
Take advantage of the reinforcing effect of caffeine by drinking
your green tea along with something healthy you wish you liked
more, but don’t consume large amounts of caffeine within six hours
of bedtime. Taking your tea without sweetener is best, but if you
typically sweeten your tea with honey or sugar, try yacón syrup
instead.
STAY HYDRATED
Check this box if your urine never appears darker than a pale yellow .
Note that if you’re eating riboflavin-fortified foods (such as nutritional
yeast), then base this instead on getting 9 cups of unsweetened
beverages a day for women (which would be taken care of by the
green tea and water preloading recommendations) or 13 cups a day
for men. If you have heart or kidney issues, don’t increase fluid intake
at all without first talking with your doctor. Remember, diet soda may
be calorie free, but it’s not consequence free, as we learned in the
Low in Added Sugar section of How Not to Diet.
DEFLOUR YOUR DIET
Check this box every day your whole-grain servings are in the form of
intact grains. The powdering of even 100% whole grains robs our
microbiome of the starch that would otherwise be ferried down to our
colon enclosed in unbroken cell walls.
FRONT-LOAD YOUR CALORIES
There are metabolic benefits to distributing more calories to earlier in
the day, so make breakfast (ideally) or lunch your largest meal of the
day in true king/prince/pauper style.
TIME-RESTRICT YOUR EATING
Confine eating to a daily window of time of your choosing under
twelve hours in length that you can stick to consistently, seven days a

================================================================================
PAGE 26
================================================================================
week. Given the circadian benefits of reducing evening food intake,
the window should end before 7:00 p.m.
OPTIMIZE EXERCISE TIMING
The Daily Dozen’s recommendation for optimum exercise duration for
longevity is ninety minutes of moderately intense activity a day , which
is also the optimum exercise duration for weight loss. Anytime is
good, and the more the better, but there may be an advantage to
exercising in a fasted state, at least six hours after your last meal.
Typically, this would mean before breakfast, but if you timed it right,
you could exercise midday before a late lunch or, if lunch is eaten
early enough, before dinner. This is the timing for nondiabetics.
Diabetics and prediabetics should instead start exercising thirty
minutes after the start of a meal and ideally go for at least an hour to
completely straddle the blood sugar peak. If you had to choose a
single meal to exercise after, it would be dinner, due to the circadian
rhythm of blood sugar control that wanes throughout the day. Ideally,
though, breakfast would be the largest meal of the day, and you’d
exercise after that – or, even better, after every meal.
WEIGH YOURSELF TWICE A DAY
Regular self-weighing is considered crucial for long-term weight
control, but there is insufficient evidence to support a specific
frequency of weighing. My recommendation is based on the one
study that found that twice daily – upon waking and right before bed –
appeared superior to once a day (about 6 versus 2 pounds of weight
loss over 12 weeks).
COMPLETE YOUR IMPLEMENTATION INTENTIONS
Every two months, create three new implementation intentions – ‘if X,
then Y’ plans to perform a particular behavior in a specific context –
and check each one of them off as you complete them every day.
EVERY NIGHT
FAST AFTER 7:00 P .M.

================================================================================
PAGE 27
================================================================================
Because of our circadian rhythm, food eaten at night is more fattening
than the exact same food eaten earlier in the day, so fast every night
for at least twelve hours starting before 7:00 p.m. The fewer calories
after sundown, the better.
GET SUFFICIENT SLEEP
Check this box if you get at least seven hours of sleep at your regular
bedtime.
EXPERIMENT WITH MILD TRENDELENBURG
Try spending at least four hours a night lying with your body tilted
head-down 6 degrees by elevating the posts at the foot of your bed
by 20 cm (or by 25 cm if your bed is extra long). Be extremely careful
when you get out of bed, as this may cause orthostatic intolerance,
even if you’re young and healthy – meaning if you get up too fast, you
can feel dizzy, faint or light-headed and could fall and hurt yourself.
So, get up slowly. Drinking a large glass of cold water (around 500ml)
thirty minutes before rising may also help prevent this potentially
hazardous side effect.
IMPORTANT: Do not try this at home at all if you have any heart or
lung issues, acid reflux, or problems with your brain (e.g., head
trauma) or eyes (even a family history of glaucoma disqualifies you).
Also do not try this until you ask your doctor whether he or she thinks
it’s safe for you to sleep in mild Trendelenburg.
TICK ALL THE RIGHT BOXES
Between the twenty-four checkoffs in the Daily Dozen and the thirty-
four new checkoffs in the Tweaks, you may feel a bit overwhelmed,
but it’s easy to knock off a bunch at a time. For example, starting a
meal with a tomato salad sprinkled with some nigella seeds, garlic
powder and balsamic vinegar hits five boxes right there, including the
‘Preload with “Negative Calorie” Foods’ tweak and the Daily Dozen
box for ‘Other Vegetables’. And if that was one of your
implementation intentions, make that six! Ten per cent of your boxes
nailed with a single appetizer.

 SPRING GREENS SOUP WITH ROASTED
ASPARAGUS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
This bright and comforting soup is packed with fresh greens,
peas and roasted asparagus. Enjoy it hot, warm or chilled.
8 ounces/225g thin asparagus, trimmed and cut into 1½-inch (4cm) pieces
(reserve the tips)
1 onion, chopped
2 teaspoons finely chopped garlic
6 cups/1.5 litres Light Vegetable Broth (here)
6 cups/150g coarsely chopped spinach or chard
2 cups/50g coarsely chopped rocket, watercress or mustard greens
1 cup/150g fresh or thawed frozen peas
3 spring onions, coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
1 teaspoon white miso paste
Ground black pepper
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 tablespoon coarsely ground nigella seeds
Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/gas mark 6. Line a rimmed roasting
tin with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Arrange all of the cut asparagus in the prepared roasting tin in a
single layer, but keep the tips separate from the rest of the

PAGE 33
================================================================================
asparagus. Roast in the oven until tender and the edges begin to
brown, about 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside, again
keeping the tips separate.
Heat ¼ cup/60ml of water in a large saucepan over medium heat.
Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the
garlic and cook, stirring, for another minute. Add the Light Vegetable
Broth and bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 7
minutes. Remove the pot from the heat. Stir in the spinach, rocket,
peas and spring onions and cook until the greens are wilted and
tender from the hot broth, about 2 minutes. Stir in the roasted
asparagus (except the tips), nutritional yeast, miso paste and black
pepper to taste.
Working in batches, transfer the soup to a high-powered blender and
blend until smooth. Return the soup to the pot and heat, if desired.
Stir in the lemon juice and then taste and adjust the seasonings, if
needed. Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the asparagus tips
and nigella seeds.

MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
The traditional Portuguese soup is made with dark greens,
potatoes and sliced sausage, but this elevated, healthier
version keeps the greens while swapping in butternut squash
for potatoes (though you can add potatoes, too, if you’d like*)
and replaces the sausage with red kidney beans.
1 red onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 butternut squash, halved, de-seeded and cut into ½-inch (1cm) dice (about
3½ cups/490g)
½ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
2 bay leaves
6 cups/1.5 litres Light Vegetable Broth ( here)
6 cups/220g chopped fresh kale, collards or other dark greens
1½ cups/265g cooked** or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free red
kidney beans, drained and rinsed
Super-Charged Spice Blend (here)
1 teaspoon white miso paste
3 tablespoons nutritional yeast
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
Heat ¼ cup/60ml water in a large pot over medium heat. Add the
onion, garlic, squash, oregano, red pepper flakes and bay leaves.
Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the Light Vegetable Broth and
bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer and cook, partially
covered, until the vegetables are just tender, about 20 minutes. Stir in
the kale, kidney beans and Super-Charged Spice Blend to taste and
cook for 10 minutes longer.

================================================================================
PAGE 42
================================================================================
In a small bowl, combine the miso paste with about ¼ cup/60ml of the
hot broth, stirring to blend. Pour the miso mixture into the soup and
remove and discard the bay leaves. Stir in the nutritional yeast and
parsley. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if needed. Serve hot.
* I left white potatoes out of my How Not to Die Cookbook because
there are healthier choices, such as sweet potatoes, but, as I noted in
How Not to Diet, plain potatoes rank as one of the most satiating
foods ever tested, so they made the cut for this collection of recipes.

 BORSCHT WITH CABBAGE AND DILL

RIBOLLITA WITH WHITE BEANS AND CAVOLO
NERO
MAKES: 6 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Ribollita is an Italian peasant soup that, like most soups,
tastes even better when reheated and served the next day, as
the flavours are allowed to develop even more – hence the
name ribollita, which means ‘reboiled’. Traditional ribollita
contains Parmesan and chunks of crusty Italian bread, but
this cleaner, more modern version skips the cheese and
bread in favour of superstars cavolo nero and cabbage. This
soup is delicious no matter when you enjoy it, but if you have
time, try to prepare it a day before you plan to serve it so it’ s
truly a ribollita, a ‘reboiled’ peasant soup.
1 large red onion, chopped
4 garlic cloves, finely chopped
2 carrots, chopped
6 cups/1.5 litres Light Vegetable Broth (here)
2 celery stalks, chopped
2 floury potatoes, diced
1 head savoy cabbage, chopped
1 bunch cavolo nero, chopped
2 (400g) BPA-free tins or Tetra Paks salt-free chopped tomatoes, undrained
3 cups/525g cooked* or 2 (400g) BPA-free tins or Tetra Paks salt-free cannellini
beans, drained and rinsed
¼ to ½ teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 sprig rosemary
1 bay leaf

 HOT AND SOUR SOUP WITH SHIITAKES
AND ASIAN GREENS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
This soup is easily customizable to please your palate. If you
don’t like spicy food, feel free to cut back on the hot chillies or
even skip them altogether, for instance. And if you prefer as
heartier soup, add some cooked whole grains or 100%
buckwheat noodles just before serving.
6 cups/1.5 litres Light Vegetable Broth (here)
1 (4-inch/10cm) piece lemongrass, crushed
2 (¼-inch/1cm) slices fresh ginger
1 garlic clove, crushed
4 cups/400g thinly sliced bok choy, napa cabbage or other Asian greens
3 cups/225g sliced shiitake mushroom caps
2 shallots, cut lengthways into thin slivers
1 or 2 serrano or other small hot chillies, de-seeded and thinly sliced
1 cup/110g grated carrot
2 cups/300g cherry tomatoes, quartered
3 spring onions, chopped
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons Dr Greger’s Special Spice Blend (here), or to taste
¼ cup/4 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander or Thai basil
In a large pot, combine the Light Vegetable Broth, lemongrass, ginger
and garlic. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to low, cover and

simmer for 20 minutes. Strain the broth through a sieve and discard
the aromatics.
Return the broth to the large pot and bring to the boil. Add the bok
choy, mushrooms, shallots, chillies and carrot. Lower the heat to low
and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes, spring onions, apple

We eat first with our eyes, and the lovely green broccoli
florets against a backdrop of cheesy broth will have you

The refreshing Japanese ‘scattered sushi’ salad known as
chirashi-zushi  typically calls for raw fish on a bed of rice. This
lighter version features vegetables instead of fish, and quinoa
replaces the sticky rice. The salad is topped with nori strips as
a nod to the sea.
1 cup/170g uncooked quinoa, well rinsed
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 tablespoon white miso paste
1 carrot, cut into thin, 2-inch/5cm strips
1 cup/75g de-stemmed and thinly sliced shiitake mushrooms
1 cup/150g frozen peas
1 cup/100g trimmed and diagonally cut 1-inch/2.5cm pieces of mange tout
1 cup/100g fresh bean sprouts
1 spring onion, finely chopped
1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 sheet nori, cut into 2-inch × ¼-inch/ 5cm × 5mm strips
Umami Sauce Redux (here)
Bring 2 cups/500ml of water to the boil in a saucepan. Add the quinoa
and lower the heat to low. Cover and simmer until the water is
absorbed, about 15 minutes. Drain well to remove any excess
moisture and set aside for 5 minutes to make sure all the water is
absorbed. Sprinkle the cooked quinoa with the vinegar and toss
gently to combine. Transfer the quinoa to a shallow serving bowl and
set aside to cool to room temperature.
In a saucepan over a medium heat, combine 1 cup/250ml of water
with the miso paste, stirring to dissolve the miso. Bring the water to a

simmer, add the carrot, mushrooms and peas and cook until
softened, about 2 minutes. Add the mange tout and bean sprouts and
cook until the mange tout turn bright green, about 1 minute longer .
Remove from the heat. Drain well and rinse under cold water to stop
the cooking process and cool the vegetables.
Spread (‘scatter’) the vegetables over the quinoa. Sprinkle with the
spring onion, sesame seeds and nori strips. Serve at room
temperature with the Umami Sauce Redux on the table to add as
desired.
THE BEST WAY TO COOK VEGETABLES
Healthy antioxidant plant pigments appear to be sensitive
to really high temperatures, so avoid frying, especially
deep-frying.31 Blanching – submerging veggies into
boiling water for three minutes, then running them under
cold water – was even better than boiling; and steam
blanching – steaming veggies for three minutes, then
letting them cool off – may be even better.32

EFFECTS OF AVOCADOS ON
INFLAMMATION
Researchers compared ice cream to the same calories of
avocado. Unlike the ice cream, the avocado, despite
being packed with calories and fat, did not produce a rise
in oxidative or inflammatory activity. Sugar is okay in fruit
form because it comes naturally pre-packaged with
phytonutrients. Similarly, the fat in whole plant foods,
such as nuts and avocados, comes pre-packaged with ‘a
rich matrix of phytochemicals and therefore does not
demonstrate the same potential for oxidative damage.’33

LETTUCE CUPS WITH CURRIED TEMPEH AND
CHICKPEAS
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
Two tips for you: If you make the curried tempeh and
chickpeas in advance of when you want to serve this dish, the
flavours will have time to merge and get even bolder. And
small, soft lettuce leaves make the best cups for holding the
salad.
8 ounces/225g tempeh, steamed for 20 minutes, then cooled and crumbled
1½ cups/250g cooked* or 1 (400g) BPA-free tin or Tetra Pak salt-free
chickpeas, drained and rinsed
½ cup/50g chopped celery
⅓ cup/60g grated carrot
1 Fuji or Gala apple, cored and coarsely chopped
1 tablespoon chopped spring onion
1½ teaspoons curry powder, or to taste
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon white miso paste
8 to 10 whole leaves round lettuce
In a food processor or a large bowl, combine the crumbled tempeh,
chickpeas (lightly mashed if using a bowl instead of a food
processor), celery, carrot, apple, spring onion, curry powder, lemon
juice and miso paste. Add 3 tablespoons of water. Pulse or mix until
combined. If using a food processor, pulse less if you want the salad
to be chunky or pulse more if you prefer a smoother salad mixture. If
using a bowl, the mixture will be very chunky. Taste and adjust the
seasonings, if needed.

To assemble, spoon the curried tempeh and chickpeas into the
lettuce leaf cups and serve immediately.

SHOULD WOMEN WITH FIBROIDS AVOID
SOYA?
About one in four women will suffer from fibroids, most
commonly with excessively heavy periods and pain or
pressure.34 Is there a link to soya? No. The amount of
soya phytoestrogen in three to five cups of soya milk a
day had no significant effect on the frequency or growth
of fibroids.35

MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy
This popular Indonesian vegetable salad takes a little time to
prepare all the components, but it’s easy to assemble. Use
more or less cayenne (or none at all) according to your own
taste.
PEANUT SAUCE
1 garlic clove, crushed
1½ tablespoons grated fresh ginger
¼ to ½ teaspoon cayenne, to taste
1 teaspoon ground coriander
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon onion powder
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
⅓ cup/60g smooth unsalted peanut butter

1 large sweet potato, cut into ¼-inch/5mm slices
8 ounces/225g green beans, trimmed and cut into 1½-inch/4cm pieces
2 carrots, thinly sliced

================================================================================
PAGE 124
================================================================================
8 ounces/225g steamed tempeh, cut into ½-inch/1cm dice
Chopped fresh coriander
2 to 3 tablespoons roasted unsalted peanuts
FOR THE PEANUT SAUCE: Combine all the peanut sauce ingredients,
except the hot water, in a small blender and blend until smooth. Add
hot water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until your desired consistency is
reached. The peanut sauce should be pourable, but not too thin and
watery. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed.
FOR THE SALAD: Preheat the oven to 220°C/425°F/gas mark 7. Line a
baking tray with a silicone mat or baking parchment.
Spread out the sweet potato slices in a single layer on the prepared
tray and bake until softened and slightly browned, about 20 minutes.
Set aside.
While the sweet potato is roasting, bring a saucepan of water fitted
with a steamer basket to the boil over a medium-high heat. Add the
green beans and carrots and steam until just tender, about 3 minutes.
Transfer the green beans and carrots to a bowl of ice water to stop
the cooking process. Drain and set aside.
TO SERVE:  Spread the shredded lettuce in a large shallow bowl or on a
platter. In separate piles, top the lettuce with all of the cooked and
raw vegetables, as well as the tempeh, in this order: roasted sweet
potato, steamed green beans, steamed carrots, sliced cucumber,
sliced red bell pepper, bean sprouts, steamed tempeh and coriander.
Ladle some of the peanut sauce over the dish, sprinkle on the
peanuts, and serve the remaining sauce on the side.

COURGETTE LINGUINE WITH MUSHROOM–
LENTIL BOLOGNESE
MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate
If you’ve never made your own courgette noodles, you may
be surprised how easy it is. Simply cut the squash into long,
thin strips, using a mandoline slicer, sharp knife or a peeler, or
just use a spiralizer, if you have one. The squash strips
should resemble strands of pasta. If you don’t have time to
make your own, look for packages of already spiralized
courgette noodles in the produce section of your
supermarket. You can also substitute 8 ounces/225g of
whole-grain or bean-based linguine, if you prefer. I use black
lentils in the sauce, but you can use any type of lentils you
have on hand.
BOLOGNESE SAUCE
¾ cup/150g dried black lentils
1 onion, finely chopped
3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
8 ounces/225g baby portobello mushrooms, finely chopped
3 tablespoons salt-free tomato puree
1 tablespoon white miso paste
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon dried basil
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)
2 (400g) BPA-free tins or Tetra Paks salt-free finely chopped tomatoes
